GNU Web Translators Manual

This manual is a guide for the GNU Web Translators.
Last updated on 28.06.2012, for GNUnited Nations version 0.6.

1 Introduction
**************

This manual is an attempt to describe in detail the process of
translating www.gnu.org articles--how to join a team, or start a new
one, the responsibilities of the team members and leaders, as well as
some peculiarities of the GNU Project's website when it comes to
localization.

   The GNU website contains hundreds of documents, most of them
philosophical articles (essays) and technical documents which need to be
translated to make them available to a broader audience.  This is
especially important for the philosophy-related materials, as many
people do not speak English and even those that do usually prefer to
read such articles in their native language.  Dealing with the task of
translating a website this large is a hard job, and too often people
volunteering as translators get frustrated or lose interest in keeping
up with that work.  Reading this manual, and the related GNUN manual
(*note GNUnited Nations: (gnun)Top.), is just the tip of the iceberg.
This is not meant to discourage any potential volunteer; rather, we
prefer to be honest and to give preliminary estimation of the
work/responsibility involved--if you feel you are not in a position to
help you may move on to a smaller project before going through all
procedures.

   It is important to realize that being a GNU Web Translator is a hard
job at all levels, but your help is much appreciated and is invaluable
contribution to the society.  While there are many people who contribute
to our community by writing free software (and their number is
constantly increasing), the ones actively engaged in teaching others to
appreciate and defend their freedom are only a few.  Consequently and
rather unfortunately, there are not so many volunteers willing to
maintain on the long term translations of the various essays that
describe the fundamental values of the free software movement.

   Translators of the `http://gnu.org' website are organized in
language teams.  Each team has one or more co-ordinators, who are
responsible for the respective team.  The co-ordinators participate in
the Savannah `trans-coord' organizational project, which is managed by
the GNU Web Translation Managers.  The manual is organized in chapters
that follow the organizational structure of the whole translation
project.

   If you wish to join a translation team or contribute a translation or
two, *note Members::.  If your intention is to form a translation team,
*note Leaders::.  The chapter about the `trans-coord' administrators
(a.k.a. "GNU Translation Managers") describes all the responsibilities
and procedures involved in performing this duty.  *Note Translation
Managers::.

2 Team Members
**************

Being a team member means to co-operate with a group of other people,
working under the co-ordinatorship of the appointed team leader.
Usually, this involves translating articles and reviewing/proof-reading
other people's translations, participating in discussions about
terminology issues, and sometimes performing clean-up tasks.

2.1 Joining A Team
==================

To join a team, please first look at the existing teams at
`http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.translations.html#TranslationsUnderway'.
Chances are that there is already an established team.  If there is no
team listed for your language, this means that:

   * There is no team established and there are no translations to this
     language.

   * Some translations were submitted by occasional contributors, but
     no team has ever been formed.

   * The page is not updated to reflect the current situation (this
     shouldn't happen, but it's a possibility anyway).

   If the team is marked as "orphaned", there is no problem: you can
still submit your translation to <web-translators@gnu.org> (*note
Submitting::).  In case you want to establish a new translation team or
become a co-ordinator of an existing one, please refer to the next
chapter, *note Leaders::.

   Contacting the team is best done via Savannah--each translation team
has its own project, named `www-LANG', with the project page being
<https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/www-LANG>.  Usually teams have
mailing lists, typically in the form <www-LANG-...@gnu.org>.  Some
teams have homepages,
<http://gnu.org/server/standards/translations/LANG> with additional
contact details and procedures for team members.

   You could also write directly to the team leader via the Savannah
interface--that way your request will be recorded by Savannah and can be
tracked or completed when the membership is approved.

   The actual process of submitting translations for review varies from
team to team, as teams have certain liberties to organize themselves as
they see fit.  Thus, this manual does not make any attempt to cover that
aspect--please refer to the team-specific documentation (if any) or ask
the co-ordinator.

   Certainly, it is not mandatory to be an active team member to
contribute a translation or two.  If you feel that you don't have the
time to participate actively, that is fine; you can still send your
translation to the team.  No contributions should be rejected.

   If you do not hear from the team within a reasonable time frame (say,
two weeks), please write to <web-translators@gnu.org>.

   For general information about the translation process, *note
Translation Tips::.

2.2 How To Submit a Translation
===============================

Everyone can still submit translations even if there is no translation
team formed.  There are two ways to do that--following the existing
procedures, which is the preferred way, and sending it as plain text,
which means more work for a limited group of volunteers (the Translation
Managers) to convert the translation in `.po' format.

2.2.1 How To Submit a Translation in PO Format
----------------------------------------------

All translations(1) are maintained via GNUN (see
`http://www.gnu.org/software/gnun/'), which significantly eases
maintenance and avoids the unpleasant situation where a translation is
lagging behind the original.  *Note Advantages: (gnun)Advantages.

   As of September 2008 all new translations at gnu.org are installed in
`.po' format, and the `.html' is generated automatically.  Here are the
steps to produce and submit such a translation:

   * Make a checkout of the CVS Web repository of the `www' Savannah
     project.  You can find generic instructions at
     `https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=www'.  All updates to the
     website are done as commits in the repository, so you would need an
     up-to-date working copy.  Anonymous access works under any
     circumstances, i.e. it is not mandatory to have a registered
     account at Savannah to use it.  You can also check out only a
     specific directory, for example:

          cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/web/www co www/gnu

     This command will fetch only the `/gnu' directory--in other words,
     all articles at `http://gnu.org/gnu'.

   * Assuming you already know the article you want to translate, you
     have to create an empty `ARTICLE.LANG.po' file and then translate
     all messages with a PO editor.  *Note New Translation: (gnun)New
     Translation.  For an almost complete list of PO editors, *note PO
     Files: (gnun)PO Files.

   * When you are pleased with the translation, check that the PO file
     is valid and submit it to <web-translators@gnu.org>, attached to
     your message.  The web-translators will review (to the best of
     their ability) the translation and will install it in the
     repository.

   * In order GNUN to be able to generate (and subsequently update) a
     gettextized translation, the language should have the server
     templates available as PO files.  These templates are short, and
     translating them shouldn't take much time.  If the language code
     is present in the `TEMPLATE_LINGUAS' variable at
     `server/gnun/gnun.mk', then you don't have to do anything.  If it
     is not, the required files are `server/po/head-include-2.LANG.po',
     `server/po/body-include-1.LANG.po',
     `server/po/body-include-2.LANG.po' and
     `server/po/footer-text.LANG.po'--you can translate and submit them
     in the usual way, together with the translation of the essay.

     Additional templates are defined via the EXTRA-TEMPLATES variable
     in `server/gnun/gnun.mk'.

     If you don't want to translate the templates for whatever
     reason--do not worry, the web-translators will install empty
     templates (which means the English strings will be used).

   It is quite possible that there will be errors or typos, so once you
are informed that the translation is online, check it carefully and if
necessary, resubmit the PO file with corrections.  Do not forget to run
`cvs update' first and edit the updated `.po' file from the
repository--most probably the Translation Managers have already made
some modifications to it, usually to fix validation errors and to
complete the PO file header.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Well--not really, but the goal is to maintain all of them.

2.2.2 How To Submit a Translation as Plain Text
-----------------------------------------------

If you feel the procedure described in the previous section is too
burdensome and unfeasible for you to follow, you can still submit a
translation in plain text.  It will be manually converted to PO file by
the GNU Web Translation Managers, which can be tricky sometimes, and
naturally, means more work for them and slower processing of your
request.

   You should _never_ translate the HTML markup--i.e. _do not_ use the
"View Source" functionality of your browser to translate the raw HTML.
Most of it is irrelevant, and automatically inherited from the markup
of the original article.  Simply save your translation in a plain text
file (`.txt'), preferably in UTF-8 encoding.  You can use any decent
text editor for that--Emacs, Vim, gEdit, Kate, OpenOffice.org (the file
should be saved as `.txt', not `.odt'), etc.

   Translate the title, the blue heading (if it differs slightly from
the title) and the body of the article upto the link `back to top'.
For example, for `http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html' that
would be:

     The Free Software Definition - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)

     We maintain this free software definition...
     ...
     ...If you would like to review the complete list of changes, you can
     do so on our cvsweb interface.

   Since web-translators do not speak all languages, it is essential to
mark somehow any inner markup, because very often it is hard to figure
out what translated text should be enclosed inside `<em>' or `<a>'
elements, to name a few.  The easiest way to do this is just to use the
corresponding HTML markup, although anything else is suitable.  For
example, here is how to indicate that the link "History section" at the
first paragraph of the same article should correspond to "seccio'n
historial" in the translation:

     Si quisiera revisar los cambios que hemos hecho, por favor vea la
     {seccio'n historial} ma's abajo para ma's informacio'n.

   It is not necessary to include the value of the `href' attribute, as
it is already known.

   If you wish your name to appear in the footer as a translator of the
article, please also provide a translation of `Translation: YOUR NAME
IN YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE' or `Translated by: YOUR NAME IN YOUR NATIVE
LANGUAGE', as you prefer.  Please also state if you wish your email
address to be published (some readers prefer to send suggestions
directly to the translator, but we certainly do not require that
translators must publish their address).

   Finally, send the translation to <web-translators@gnu.org>, either
inline or as an attachment to your message.  Once online, please check
for any errors or omissions that may have resulted from the conversion
process, and report them back.

2.3 Leaving A Team
==================

When you realize that you don't have time or can't devote sufficient
resources to perform the tasks anymore, it is prudent to inform the
translation team co-ordinator and possibly all the rest of the
team-mates.  The team leader should always have a rough estimation about
the available translators, even though there are no reliable means to
establish that.  Your announcement that you are stepping down
(temporarily or permanently) may help her in this regard.

3 Team Co-ordinators
********************

A gnu.org translation team leader is the person who is ultimately
responsible for organizing and managing the team, including, but not
limited to, having the final say on contributed translations and
exercising levels of control as she sees fit.

   A prospective team co-ordinator should have perfect understanding of
the GNU Philosophy and the various issues the free software movement
set out to solve.  Energy and time are always needed, as well as certain
communication skills.

   However, a team leader is not a dictator (for life); every action
and/or decision taken should have its justification and should stem
from the goals of the project at large.  Inefficient or inoperative
leaders are replaced, if necessary.

3.1 How To Form A New Team
==========================

Establishing a new team is not hard, but a certain procedure ought to be
followed.  The most important thing to realize is that this is somewhat
a long-term engagement that requires a lot of spare time, communication
and technical skills, and devotion.  The only "bonus" team leaders have
is more work and more responsibilities.

   You should read and _all_ the documentation related to the
translation process at the very least all important philosophy-related
articles listed on
`http://gnu.org/server/standards/README.translations.html' and
`http://gnu.org/server/standards/translations/priorities.html' before
you decide to form a new team, or take over an orphaned team.  Once you
have the internal feeling that having a gnu.org translation team for
your language is a must, and you are the one for this job, follow these
steps:

  1. If you do not have a Savannah account, register at
     `https://savannah.gnu.org/account/register.php'.  Write access to
     the repository and project membership is handled via Savannah, so
     you would need an account in any case.

  2. Checkout a complete working copy of the CVS Web repository as
     described at `https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=www'.  If you
     still don't have a Savannah account or if you have registered one,
     but are not yet member of any Savannah project, refer to the
     instructions under "Anonymous CVS Access".  If you are already a
     member of (any) Savannah project, you can proceed with "Project
     Member CVS Access via SSH", although you will still lack
     permission to commit (later, when it is granted, you can use the
     same working copy).

     Examine the layout and structure of the repository.  Basically, it
     is mapped to the URL locations, more or less.  Take a look at the
     most important materials to translate under `/philosophy', `/gnu',
     `/distros', `/copyleft' and `/licenses' directories just to get a
     rough estimate about the amount of work involved.  If you are
     still not scared and determined to go on further, excellent.

     As you have probably observed, every directory that contains
     translatable articles has a `/po' sub-directory, which is where the
     canonical source format of the translations is stored.

  3. Submit your first message stating that you would like to establish
     a new team to <web-translators@gnu.org>; please mention that you
     have read all the documentation and list the issues that remain
     unclear for you.  The Translation Managers will answer your
     questions and send you the standard questionnaire for new team
     leaders.  It is short and shouldn't take more than 10-30 minutes
     to complete.  This questionnaire is important, as we consider it
     crucial for any translation team co-ordinator to have a good
     understanding of the philosophy of the free software movement.

  4. Check if your language code is present in the variable
     `TEMPLATE_LINGUAS' at `server/gnun/gnun.mk'.  If it is not, the
     first thing to do is to translate and submit to
     <web-translators@gnu.org> the following files (all in the
     `server/po/' directory): `head-include-2.LANG.po',
     `body-include-1.LANG.po', `body-include-2.LANG.po'
     `footer-text.LANG.po', `outdated.LANG.po',
     `skip-translations.LANG.po', and `top-addendum.LANG.po'.  *Note
     New Translation: (gnun)New Translation.

        - The language code (LANG) should be the ISO 639-1 code of the
          language, for example `hy' for Armenian or `el' for Greek.  If
          there is no such code, use the ISO 639-2 one--e.g. `mai' for
          Maithili.  If the language is a variant such as Brazilian
          Portuguese or Simplified Chinese, use small caps and a
          dash--`pt-br' and `zh-cn' instead of `pt_BR' and `zh_CN'.

        - The PO file header and initial comments should be completed as
          documented.

        - Do not use HTML entities for non-ASCII characters as in the
          English original.  They are harder to type and read.  So, if
          there is `&uuml;' and this is a character from the alphabet
          of your language, just write it as `u"' directly.

  5. Any prospective team leader should submit a few translations first.
     This is a process of pointing errors and omissions (which are
     expected and natural); it's an important thing to do as the leader
     is going to carry out these checks on her own, once the team is
     approved.  If there are existing translations that are not yet in
     PO format, the best thing to do is to migrate one or two.  You can
     use `find' to find out what's already in the repository, for
     example:

          find -name \*.LANG.html

  6. Submit at least two translations of your own.  We maintain a list
     with priority articles at
     `http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/translations/priorities.html',
     although it is probably hard to start with one of them.  Choose
     whatever you wish, provided it is an essay and not an auxiliary
     page.  Avoid translating the homepage or `whatsnew.html'--they are
     moving targets and keeping up would be only a distraction for both
     parties in the process.  As usual, send the completed translation
     to <web-translators@gnu.org>.

  7. The Translation Managers will review your translations, and
     eventually comment on them (mostly technical details if there is
     no one among them speaking your language).  Depending on the case,
     it might be required to submit a corrected file.  In any event,
     please take into account the remarks in future work.

  8. If all goes well, you will receive a response inviting you to
     apply for a new translation project at Savannah.  The project name
     should be `www-LANG' where LANG is, unsurprisingly, the language
     code.  If such a project already exists, this step will be skipped
     and you'll be made an administrator of the project.  To register
     the project, go to `https://savannah.gnu.org/register/' and make
     sure you fill in the required fields.  The "Group type" should be
     `www.gnu.org translation team', and "Project license"--`WebSite
     Only'.  In the "Tarball URL" field enter a bogus URL such as
     `http://gnu.org'.

     *Pay attention:* This step is a formality.  You should proceed
     with the project registration only when you have been asked by
     <web-translators@gnu.org> to do so.  Otherwise, the submission may
     appear in the task list of the Savannah Hackers for a fairly long
     time, which is troublesome.

  9. When the project is approved, the team information will be added
     to the list at `README.translations.html', you will become a
     member of the `www' project (thus granting you CVS write access to
     the whole repository--so be careful) and the `trans-coord'
     project.  You'll also be subscribed to the following mailing lists:

        - www-commits

        - trans-coord-discuss

     You'll have to request subscription to `www-discuss'
     yourself--this list is managed by the GNU Webmasters, but all team
     leaders are required to subscribe in order to receive important
     site-wide announcements.

   The whole process should not take more than two weeks or maximum a
month--if this period turns out to be longer, it is an indication that
you do not have the required time and resources for this job, or
web-translators are badly lagging behind and do not process the requests
with the expected pace.

   Applications for new teams are sometimes processed in
parallel(1)--the most suitable candidate is chosen in this case.  This
is, undoubtedly, based on a subjective judgment made by the Translation
Managers, and many factors are important.

   The procedure for taking over an orphaned team is the same.  Once
completed, you will be made an admin of the respective `www-LANG'
Savannah project, or if it doesn't exist, invited to apply for
registration.  Do not automatically remove old members just because you
are starting "afresh"--some of them might want to continue to
contribute.  Contact them privately, explaining that you're the new
appointed team co-ordinator, and ask them if they would be willing to
continue their involvement in the team.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In general, we try to avoid this and direct all new volunteers
to the person who is already carrying out the process--this is also a
verification if she can cooperate easily with others.

3.2 The Gentle Art of Managing A Translation Team
=================================================

It is not our ambition to describe all activities involved in managing a
team--it's very likely that you will encounter new problems, take care
of tasks nobody else is aware of, or invent new techniques and
approaches in your quest to keep things running.  Managing a team is a
hard task on all counts: communication with others, recruiting
volunteers (and keeping them as long as possible), defending certain
decisions, leading discussions about terminology issues, handling
personal conflicts within the team, technical skills when
reviewing/merging/syncing translations, etc.  The list goes on and on.

   This manual can only summarize some of the most common issues and
_suggest_ ways to deal with them.  It is up to the team leader to
establish the precise team procedures and practices.

   The <trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org> mailing list was specifically
created to discuss issues that leaders encounter while managing the
teams, and for general organizational work.  Feel free to discuss
anything related to the translation process there.

3.2.1 Peer Review
-----------------

First and foremost, find at least one person for peer review.  You will
review her translations, and she will review yours (at least in the
beginning).  Being a team leader does not mean that you cannot make
mistakes; everyone does.  The mutual review (especially if done by a
larger group) is crucial for the quality of the translation process.
Too many errors are just missed (especially if they are obvious) when
the translator does a final review of her own translation.

   It is good to establish a practice: Do not commit officially (i.e. in
`www', which will appear online at `http://gnu.org' immediately) a
translation that is not yet reviewed by someone else who is not the
translator.  Always perform a final review yourself even if the
translation has been checked by another member of the team.  In other
words, every translation installed at gnu.org should pass through your
hands (read: eyes).

   One common technique for performing such reviews is to use a mailing
list--the translator sends the new translation and participants comment
on specific parts, quoting them appropriately.  The benefit of this
approach is that it is straightforward, but the drawback is that there
is no automatic "record" about the conclusion of the specific
discussion (or sub-thread) and sometimes such discussions easily
digress, making it even harder to come up with a solution.

   Another way is to use Savannah's built-in trackers (the `Tasks' and
`Bugs' trackers, specifically).  This is further explained in the next
section, *note Tracking Tasks::.  One way or another, you should create
some kind of review process.

3.2.1.1 How To Track Tasks and Bugs Using Savannah
..................................................

The team leader has to make sure that prospective translations are
reviewed, that they do not contain obvious errors and/or confusing
expressions and that they match the spirit and intention of the original
essay.  However, many teams tend to suffer from a specific problem: team
members rely on the leader to make these extensive reviews. That is
fine, as far as it goes, and the leader should always review
translations before installing them in the repository--but it is nearly
impossible (especially for a large team) to rely on a single person for
such tasks.  Team co-ordinators often do not manage to make such reviews
in time, resulting in frustration among the team members and generally
slowing the translation process.

   A solution to this specific problem is to distribute the load among
more people.  For example: Member D makes a translation of `foo.html'
and uploads `foo.LANG.po' in the translation project's repository at
Savannah, marking the relevant task as "Ready for Test" (of course, the
equivalent is sending a message with the attached translation to the
team's mailing list, or similar).  Then Member A, B and C (or only A
and B if C is currently busy) review it independently and post
comments/suggestions/errors in the bug tracker.  Discussion goes on
between them and D, problems are rectified and finally the leader (who
may happen to be one of A, B, C, D) makes a final review.  It is easier
to make the final review when most of the issues are already fixed in
previous revisions.  Finally, the translation is published.  The result
is better quality of the translation (since more people looked at it)
and the whole burden does not fall solely on the shoulders of the
leader.  You can also set up an internal formal rule: If a member makes
a translation, he has to review another one (or two) as well.

   Some translations can take a fairly long time--the typical example
is a complicated essay or a transcript of a speech.  It is best to avoid
duplicate work by indicating, or better--recording, that someone is
working on this specific article.  The `Tasks' tracker is suitable for
this purpose.

   It is prudent to discuss the most convenient naming scheme and
practice among team members, and publish the convention and/or rules at
the team's homepage.  Note that you can create "Custom Fields" in the
trackers, and resolved bugs can be searched based on these custom
values.

   Thus, a possible straightforward way to manage these tasks is:

   * If someone starts working on a new translation, she creates a new
     task with a `Subject' indicating the article, for example simply
     `philosophy/bsd.html' and assigns it to herself.

   * When the translation is finished and ready for review, the
     translator changes the `Status' to "Ready For Test".

   * Other members review it, and open bugs relevant to one specific
     problem.  It is usually better not to conflate two different
     issues together--it makes them harder to discuss, and hard to
     track them by severity.  Some are grammatical errors, some are
     fundamental ones that change the whole meaning, some are simply
     suggestions for improvement.  It helps if the project admin
     creates new Category fields for every article, for instance
     `gnu/gnu-history.LANG.html', `philosophy/microsoft.LANG.html'--it
     would enable functionality like "Show me all bugs ever reported
     against this translation", which is useful.

   * Once the bugs (or at least the important bugs) are fixed, the team
     leader can make the final review and install the translation in the
     official repository, marking the task as `Done'.  Bugs that are not
     resolved should remain opened, naturally.

   Of course, teams can choose to manage these things using external
resources and eventually other bug (or issue) tracking systems.
Whatever you decide, please make sure that bugs can be reported using
free software only, and that the software providing that service is
free.  It makes an extremely bad impression if a reader has to report a
problem about a gnu.org translation via non-free hosting platforms like
SourceForge.

   If you use a certain facility (i.e. a bug tracking system) to manage
bugs in translations, it is best to take advantage of
`generic.LANG.html' and advertise it on every page.  *Note
generic.LANG.html: (gnun)generic.LANG.html, for details.

3.2.1.2 How To Proceed With Unreviewed Translations
...................................................

Sometimes a translation (typically your own) is not reviewed by anyone
else for a fairly long time.  This is unfortunate, but there is no
reason to keep it in draft state forever.  If nobody reviewed it for a
substantially long period (like 3 or 4 months), commit it as it is.
Readers may report bugs as well (and they do!).

   It is important to record somehow that this published translation
still lacks appropriate review.  If the suggestion in the previous
section is implemented, it would mean leaving the relevant task `Open'
and `Ready For Test' despite the translation being officially online.
You may also add a comment to the PO file.

3.2.2 CVS Commits And Best Practices
------------------------------------

As all team leaders have write access to the CVS repository of the
`www' project, this technically means that they are able to modify
every single file in it, and also those of the Web CVS repositories of
other projects at Savannah.  This vote of confidence should never be
abused--the only files team co-ordinators should add/update are those
relevant to their translation work.  It is OK to fix an obvious typo in
an original article; for anything else please report to
<webmasters@gnu.org>.

   If you wish to volunteer as webmaster and help with generic webmaster
work and RT tickets, that is perfectly fine--please follow the
established (by the GNU Webmasters) procedure.  If you are approved, you
can modify such pages wearing your "webmaster's hat".

   If a particular page has issues with the markup which create problems
for your language, please inform <trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org>.  For
general issues that affect more articles, or for severe problems,
please write to <www-discuss@gnu.org>.

   It is recommended to read the entire CVS manual at least once, for a
basic understanding of how this VCS works.  *Note Concurrent Versions
System: (cvs)Top.  It is not necessary to become an expert--the `www'
project does not use complex features like tags, vendor branches,
merging, etc. as they are not very useful for a live website.

   However, you'd probably have to learn how to use CVS for effective
work--to extract information from the history, review diffs and
specific changes, synchronize with the working repository of the team
(if any), adding/removing files, etc.

   If you make changes that affect more than one file but the change is
coherent, please do it as a single commit.  This will generate only one
message to <www-commits@gnu.org>, which is better than 5 messages for 5
files about semantically the same change.  Always write commit logs in
English(1), providing a short description of the change.  If you modify
a file that is not an article but a script or part of software (such as
`server/gnun/gnun.mk'), it would be nice to follow the GNU Coding
Standards and describe the change precisely.  For example, do not write:

     Added support for Nepali.

   or

     Yay!  First commit of the Panjabi homepage!

   Instead, write the log as follows:

     (TEMPLATE_LINGUAS): Add `ne'.

   and

     (HOME_LINGUAS): Add `pa'.

   This makes it easier for others to search for a particular change in
the history.

   If you add a binary file (for example, `.png'), do it with `cvs
commit -kb FILE'.  This turns off keyword substitution, which prevents
RCS keywords like `$Id$' to get expanded, subsequently corrupting the
file.  *Note Substitution Modes: (cvs)Substitution Modes.  More
importantly, using `-kb' prevents corruption of the binary when people
using CVS clients under Windoze checkout, modify the file, and then
commit it with messed EOLs.  (Unfortunately there are still committers
using non-free operating systems--we cannot dictate what OS people use,
but we can at least try to prevent damage.)

   Although not absolutely compulsory, it is recommended that every team
leader subscribes to <www-commits@gnu.org>.  It is useful to examine
the diffs of your own messages, if you miss something while inspecting
the diff before the commit.  In any case, a team leader should be
subscribed to that list to avoid his own commit messages to be
moderated.  If you absolutely do not desire receiving all traffic, just
disable mail delivery in Mailman's user interface.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This advice is applicable for the `www' repository only--feel
free to write logs in your native language when committing in your
project's Sources repository.

3.2.3 Taking Advantage of Savannah
----------------------------------

Every translation team should have a project in Savannah.  There are
some teams that use their own resources outside from Savannah; although
there's no obligation to use Savannah for team work, the need for a
Savannah project for each language is obvious: it's a standard way to
find information for translation teams and their contacts.

   Using external hosting facilities may seem justified sometimes.  Some
teams may have already established repositories and/or bug tracking
systems where usual contributors already have access.  Some team
members prefer to work within the established infrastructure of a broad
translation team (for whatever reason), but this is discouraged.  It is
required that every team has a mailing list at Savannah (*note Savannah
Mailing Lists::), because it is easier to pass its management to the
new co-ordinator when the old one steps down, and it helps to keep the
archives at one place for future members of the team.  Likewise, it is
better to use Savannah for the team's repository and bugs/tasks, but
this is not mandatory.

   However, it is important to remember that regardless of the technical
resources which a team decides to use, the responsibility of the team
co-ordinator remains the same.

   Those teams that are using Savannah have a broad variety of tools at
hand: team membership management, documents, trackers (bugs, tasks and
support), alerts, CVS (and any other VCS that Savannah supports), home
pages, etc.  How each team uses these resources is up to the team
itself, but it often turns out to choose Savannah for nearly all of the
team activities, as it requires almost zero work; the Savannah Hackers
are happy to support us.

   Whatever you (in your capacity as a team leader) decide, please do it
with caution: some organizational decisions may become ineffective as
time goes by, and some may not scale well when the team grows.  If the
team is young and has a couple of members, it is better to refrain from
such decision and discuss them with all the members when their number
grows.  Two or three people do not need a rocket platform or complex
wizardry to do their work.

   The next sections contain suggestions about how a team can use the
facilities provided by Savannah.  It is not mandatory to follow them,
they are just suggestions.

3.2.3.1 Managing Members
........................

You should add active translators as members of the translation team,
and remove them when they leave.  Team members should have access to all
of the project's resources, and tracking their number is one of the ways
for web-translators to determine the status of the team.

   It is OK if a particular contributor wants to translate an article or
two and does not want to be engaged with the team on a long-term basis.
In such situations, there is no need to add her as a member.

   It is a good idea to mark inactive members, for example if there is
no interaction (bug reports, new translations, updates to existing
translations, proof-reading) for at least six months.  You can do that
by unmarking the `On Duty' checkbox for the respective project member
under `Set Permissions'.  Inactive members have absolutely the same
rights as active ones--the only exception is that they don't count for
the total number of members, and they appear separately on `View
Members'.

3.2.3.2 Homepage of The Team
............................

Every Savannah project has a Web repository, which is, for technical and
historical reasons, only CVS.  By default it is mapped to
<http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/translations/LANG>; to add files
to it first make a checkout, following the instructions at
<https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=www-LANG>.

   It is recommended to describe all team-specific procedures, if there
are any.  That way, you can point potential team members to the
corresponding page containing these instructions, instead of repeatedly
explaining every volunteer separately.

   All team-specific pages should follow the usual linking criteria (see
`http://gnu.org/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#pollinking'
and the FSF HTML Style Sheet
Guidelines--`http://gnu.org/server/fsf-html-style-sheet.html').

   For historical reasons, team-specific materials were available in the
`www' repository, under ad-hoc locations as `/spanish', `/wwwsr', etc.
These locations are deprecated, and the contents will be moved without
warning to `/graveyard' in the `trans-coord' _Sources_ repository,
following the original `www' layout (that is, if there were any
sub-directories, they will be retained).

3.2.3.3 Support Tracker
.......................

This tracker is supposed to be related to things about the _project
management_ itself, i.e. project members may report here missing
functionality and/or features that requires the project admin(s)'s
action.  Do not use it for anything else as it quickly becomes
confusing.  It is OK to disable it if the team is small.

3.2.3.4 Tasks Tracker
.....................

This is a way to manage all sorts of tasks.  They appear in the personal
Savannah page of the assignee, so it is difficult to miss them out.  It
is possible to use this tracker to "announce" to the team members that
a specific article should be translated.  The one who volunteers may
assign the task to herself.

   Teams may use this tracker to avoid duplicate work, by declaring that
they intend to work on a specific translation.

   Feel free to organize the `Tasks' management as you see fit.

3.2.3.5 Bugs Tracker
....................

The `Bugs' tracker is designed for tracking bugs.  You can use for
several purposes:

   * Suggest readers to report bugs there.

   * Use it for all kinds of internal team tasks.

   * Forward bugs reported against LANG translations in the
     `trans-coord' project and assign them to the specific maintainer
     (who is supposed to be a `www-LANG' project member), if you have
     such policy.

3.2.3.6 Patch Tracker
.....................

This tracker doesn't make much sense for translation projects, as the
original on which the translation is based is volatile and the
translation "patch" is 100% guaranteed not to apply cleanly very soon
after it is submitted.  Even ignoring this detail, this specific
feature is slowly marching towards complete deprecation, as there are
much better ways to submit patches nowadays.

   You should disable this feature, as it causes only confusion.

3.2.3.7 News Tracker
....................

That is a way to inform newcomers and interested people (who visit the
project page from time to time, or subscribe to the `News' RSS feed)
about a major change or event within the project.

   You can also setup news entries to be sent to a mailing list (that's
possible for the other trackers as well).

   The purpose of this feature is informational--if members need to know
about an important change (in practices, procedures, etc.), it is
perfectly OK to announce it here.  Some teams use it to announce new
translations, which is also fine.

3.2.3.8 Managing Mailing Lists
..............................

Every team should have a mailing list on lists.gnu.org and use it for
internal communications.  All active translators should be on the list.
The list owner should be the co-ordinator of the team.  The name of the
list should begin with `www-LANG-'.

   The list will make it possible for the GNU project to contact the
team when the co-ordinator disappears; its archive will also give
access to the history for new translators.

   You can create new mailing lists via the Savannah interface.
However, this should be done after some thought.  If the project
membership is low (<= 10 members), there is no need to create more than
one mailing list.

   You can redirect all messages generated by the trackers to any list.

3.2.3.9 Version Control Systems
...............................

An easy way to keep up with changes in the original articles and to
manage continuous contributions is to keep all translations in the
translation project's Sources repository.  That way, it is easy to edit
draft translations and install them in `www' only when they're ready.
It is also convenient to update the translation (merge any changes from
the original) while it is still under review.

   *Note PO Files and Team: (gnun)PO Files and Team, for more
information.

   *Remember:* A choice of a particular VCS is a sensitive matter--some
modern ones provide compelling features, but they also bump the barrier
for participation higher.  The VCS is supposed to ease collaborative
maintenance--if it eases only you, project members just won't use it so
that won't be a net win.

Web-based Systems
.................

An alternative way to maintain translations is to use one of the
existing online editors.  There are plans to install a web-based system
for managing `.po' files at Savannah, including online editing and
statistics.  Until it happens, teams who wish to use this functionality
may setup such a server on a host of their own, or use one of the
existing free hosting platforms such as Launchpad
(`http://translations.launchpad.net').

   Here is a short and probably incomplete list of such systems:

   * Pootle--`http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle'

   * Vertaal--`http://code.google.com/p/vertaal'

   * Narro--`http://code.google.com/p/narro'

   * Launchpad--`https://dev.launchpad.net'


   If you decide to use such a system, please make sure that no
translations are published in HTML format there.

   Note that to keep the `.pot' files regularly updated (assuming such
a web-based system runs `msgmerge' automatically), you'll have to take
care of the one-way regular sync from the `www' CVS repository.

3.2.4 Promoting Members As Co-leaders
-------------------------------------

When the team grows large and it becomes hard for a single person to
manage, there is no problem to add another (or even another two) people
to help.  Note that a subsequently appointed team co-ordinator is not
simply a "committer" with write access to the `www' repository; she has
full responsibilities just like a single leader, although the latter
still remains the primary contact for the team.

   If you'd like another person to act as a co-leader and help you with
the management tasks, send a message to <web-translators@gnu.org> with
her name and Savannah account.  She has to be already a member of
`www-LANG'.

   The procedure for co-leaders is a simplified version of the one for a
new team or taking over an existing team.  *Note New Team::.

   To remove co-ordinators, please write to <web-translators@gnu.org>
with details and rationale for the removal.  Do not edit
`README.translations.html' yourself; this is a final formality step to
be performed by the Translation Managers.

3.3 Reporting Team Status
=========================

Team leaders must send an annual report about the status of the team.  A
good report should include:

   * General information about the team's accomplishments during the
     past year, like:

        - A list of new translations.

        - New members since the last report.

        - Current active members.

        - Solved problems and other issues, if any.  (Usual bug reports
          and other improvements/fixes to the existing translations do
          not count as "problems" in this sense.)

   * Current problems (technical or social), conflicts, and ideas for
     sorting them out.

   * Anything else you consider important or worth mentioning.

   The best time to send a report is near the end of the year, for
example November.  In any case, please do not send it later than
December 15th, as the Translation Manager has to prepare a general
report to the FSF, and it is better if it takes into account the
reports of the team leaders.

   If there is no sensitive information in the report and you feel like
sharing it, you can send it to <trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org> (which is
still a private mailing list).  That way, other list readers may help
with suggestions how to solve a particular issue.  Informing each other
about the progress improves the community spirit.

   If you do not wish to share some information that is in the report,
please send it to <web-translators@gnu.org>.

3.4 How To Retire Painlessly
============================

When you feel you don't have the energy to manage the team successfully,
or perhaps you start losing motivation, please inform
<web-translators@gnu.org>.  It would be substantially easier if you try
to find a replacement or recommend a specific person--we will try to
find someone in any case, but your judgment is important and it will be
considered with priority.

   An excellent way to step down is to do it with a "plan"--suggest the
person you consider capable of doing the job as co-leader (*note
Co-leaders::) and retire completely when she is absolutely ready to
proceed without your further help and advice.

4 `trans-coord' Admins
**********************

This chapter is not yet written.  The current admins know what to do,
hopefully.

5 Details About The Translation Process
***************************************

The purpose of this chapter is to summarize some odd and not so obvious
details about specific parts of the gnu.org website.  Most of them
become well known as time goes by; however, practice shows that it is
difficult to figure them out at once.

   Some limitations and oddities are just historical remnants from old
habits and previous incarnations of old (inefficient) translation and
webmastering processes.  Others are outright deficiencies (i.e.
"bugs"), but no one has stepped in to correct them so far.

5.1 Migration To The New Style
==============================

Migration to the new style should be straightforward, and this is one of
the problems GNUN set out to solve.  If you have to migrate old-style
translations, *note Migrating: (gnun)Migrating.  If the old translation
is HTML 2.0 (or 3.2), you still have to take care about the inner
markup.  Overall, it is substantially easier than doing all of it
manually.

   Subsequent migrations to newer HTML standards and newer look and feel
of the website are supposed to happen semi-automatically, although this
manual will be updated as needed.

5.2 Summary of SSI `#include's
==============================

The GNU Project's website uses SSI (Server Side Includes) to manage some
common parts that are the same in many of the articles.  With the help
of GNUN their handling should be behind the scenes, but for some of them
manual intervention is needed.  Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of
the `#include''s used:

`server/banner.html'
     This file contains only `#include' directives, so the
     "translation" should be identical, with filenames modified to have
     the LANG extension.

`server/body-include-1.html'
     Contains the top menu with useful "skip to" links.

`server/body-include-2.html'
     This is the file containing the menus, the FSF widget, and any
     visible announcements made from time to time.  If a string gets
     "fuzzy" or "new" here, it will appear in English in all
     translations, until `server/po/body-include-2.LANG.po' is updated.
     Note that some validation errors originate from an error in
     `server/body-include-2.LANG.html' or some other template file.

`server/footer-text.html'
     This is a very short file currently containing the "back to top"
     link.  Also translatable via GNUN.

`server/header.html'
     The declaration that is included in literally every file.  It is
     maintained manually, as it does not make much sense to put it under
     GNUN's control (there are no translatable strings).  Remember to
     specify the proper `xml:lang' and `lang' attributes, and for RTL
     languages, the `dir' attribute.  For example, the file
     `header.ar.html' should contain this line:

          <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="ar" lang="ar"
                dir="rtl">

`server/head-include-1.html'
     This file (included from `server/header.html') is very important:
     the encoding is defined here.  Note that it is applicable for all
     translations, so it is not possible to have different articles in
     different encodings.  Even if a specific PO file is deliberately
     encoded in another encoding, the generated HTML will contain the
     encoding declared in the `<meta>' element at
     `server/head-include-1.LANG.html', so browsers will obey it.

     The encoding should be UTF-8.  This is required because the
     English text in the articles serves as a replacement of the
     translation when the latter is not complete, and because all
     translated pages share automatically generated lists of
     translations.

`server/html5-header.html'
     This file is included in newer pages using some entities introduced
     in HTML5 draft.  We have to distinguish those pages since some
     features of HTML4 were rejected in HTML5, and our old pages don't
     validate as HTML5.

`server/html5-head-include-1.html'
     Likewise, this file replaces head-include-1.html for HTML5 pages.

`server/head-include-2.html'
     Imports the standard CSS, which can be overridden.  *Note CSS::.

`server/footer.html'
     This is a very short and simple file (at least at the time of
     writing), containing another `#include' directive.  It is
     maintained manually, so just add LANG to the filename, in order
     the localized `footer-text.LANG.html' to be included.

`server/outdated.html'
     This file is automatically included in outdated translations.  It
     contains respective message with links to the English file and to
     a generated difference of the current revision of the English file
     against the most recent revision that has a complete translation.
     It is only included in articles affected by "grace period" because
     in those cases the outdated passages are replaced with English
     text, and it is evident without any notices that there is no
     complete and up to date translation.

`translations.include'
     The list of translations for the homepage (and only the homepage).
     It is maintained manually; in order the link to a translation to
     appear on all of the homepages, it has to be present here.

`gnusflashes.include'
     A portion of the most recent 3 news items from
     `server/whatsnew.html', generated automatically.  If your language
     does not have `server/po/whatsnew.LANG.po', this file will be
     used.  Otherwise, if there is an existing localized homepage and
     you commit `whatsnew.LANG.po', the homepage will be rebuilt to
     include the translated `gnusflashes.LANG.include'.

`server/whatsnew.include'
     Generated automatically, this file is included from
     `server/whatsnew.html'.  Translations are built automatically, and
     the localized `gnusflashes.include' is derived from it.

`licenses/gpl-3.0-body.html'
`licenses/fdl-1.3-body.html'
`...'
     Some of the licenses have the text of the license itself separated
     in another file.  This serves two purposes: 1) to provide a
     "standalone" HTML version of the license without the gnu.org
     style; 2) to prevent strings sneaking in the `.pot' files, as
     licenses have only unofficial translations, hosted elsewhere.
     Nothing special should be done about these SSI directives; the
     files generated by GNUN include them verbatim as they should not
     be translated.

`server/sidebar*.html'
     These files are deprecated--they are remnants from an older design
     that lived shortly in the middle between the old classic design
     and the current one.  If all translations are successfully
     migrated and none of them includes such files, you should delete
     them.  You can use `grep' to check this.

   The files

   - `header.html'

   - `head-include-1.html'

   - `html5-header.html'

   - `html5-head-include-1.html'

   - `head-include-2.html'

   - `banner.html'

   - `body-include-1.html'

   - `body-include-2.html'

   - `footer.html'

   - `footer-text.html'

   in the `server' sub-directory are what webmasters call "the server
templates".  These files are included in almost every article,
translated or not.  They are somewhat important, as an error made in
translating them propagates everywhere.  The server templates, the
homepages, and whatsnew (a.k.a. "GNU News") are being rebuilt by GNUN
whenever there is a change in the original English files; the `GRACE'
variable has no effect for them.  *Note Runtime Variables:
(gnun)Runtime Variables.

5.3 How To Use Custom CSS
=========================

The CSS file `layout.css' gets included (with three other CSS files) in
almost all the English articles through
`server/head-include-2.LANG.html'.  However, sometimes this style isn't
quite right for translations--many languages have much longer
expressions, and that is natural.  To include your own CSS, create a
file `style.LANG.css' and add it _after_ the directive to include
`server/head-include-2.LANG.html' and _before_ the closing `</head>'
tag in `server/banner.LANG.html', i.e.

     <!-- start of banner.bg.html -->
     <!--#include virtual="/server/head-include-2.bg.html" -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.bg.css" media="screen" />
     </head>

   Override only what is necessary and looks broken in your language; do
not invent your own style.  This is important for the consistency of the
gnu.org website.  A typical language-specific `style.LANG.css' file
looks like this:

     .inner { max-width: 65em; }

     #logo{background:url(/graphics/topbanner.bg.png) no-repeat;}
     #fssbox {font-size: 50%;}

   This widens the menu and the area where the articles are displayed
(because the menu entries are _much_ longer than the English
equivalents when translated), includes a localized logo, and makes the
font size for the FSF widget twice smaller (because in this language,
the translations are almost twice longer and displayed truncated, which
is undesirable).

   When creating your own `style.LANG.css', don't forget to include the
license notice from the `layout.css', with a short comment.

   If using the default CSS style for translations does not give the
expected good results, or there are other problems (significant or not)
that obstruct reading and/or worsen the look from aesthetic point of
view, please write to <webmasters@gnu.org> with a description of the
issue.  If there are several unrelated problems, send separate messages
with appropriate explanation (which may include a demonstration of the
bug, such as a screenshot).

5.3.1 Localizing The `topbanner' Image
--------------------------------------

If you'd like the nice gnu image to be localized (i.e. "GNU Operating
System" to appear in your native language, here are the steps:

  1. Copy `graphics/topbanner.svg' as `graphics/topbanner.LANG.svg'
     where LANG is the language code, as usual.  Edit the file with
     Inkscape or with a plain text editor such as GNU Emacs,
     translating "GNU Operating System".  Then with Inkscape, save the
     file as `graphics/topbanner.LANG.png' (File -> Export Bitmap...).
     Then open the PNG image with the GIMP and flatten it (Image ->
     Flatten Image).  Don't forget to save and `cvs add' the files(1).

  2. Create a `style.LANG.css' at the toplevel directory, if it doesn't
     exist already.  Normally, you would need only one line in it,
     namely:

          #logo{background:url(/graphics/topbanner.LANG.png) no-repeat;}

  3. If not done already for other reasons, update `banner.LANG.html'
     to include the language specific `style.LANG.css'.  *Note CSS::.

   If you feel uncomfortable manipulating images--don't despair!  Send a
plea for help to <trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org>, some people would be
happy to help you.  Failing that, write to <www-discuss@gnu.org>.

5.3.2 Specific Issues Related to RTL
------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the `http://gnu.org' website does not have excellent
support for RTL (right-to-left) languages, although best efforts are
made.  If your language is in this category, make sure to:

   * Set the attribute `dir="rtl"' in the `html' element at
     `server/header.LANG.html'.

   * You _must_ have a custom CSS to override some of the pre-defined
     values.  See `style.ar.css' and `style.fa.css' to understand how
     these two languages solve some of the problems.  *Note CSS::.

   *Important:* Some articles contain their own `<style>'
redefinitions, or style attributes in the form `<p style="...">'.  In
such situations, it is quite possible that the general
language-specific CSS does not help, and the translation of this
specific article does not look correct.  Please write to
<webmasters@gnu.org>; if you have a working solution that works for
both cases--so much the better.  For general issues that affect your
language and require a general solution, write to <webmasters@gnu.org>
as well, precisely describing the problem.

5.4 What To Translate
=====================

The article
`http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/translations/priorities.html'
lists the most important essays to translate.  In general, articles in
the directories `philosophy', `gnu', `education', `distros', `copyleft'
and `licenses' are important.  The others may be deferred for a time
when a team completes most of the important translations, or they can
be translated as a "rest"-in translators' parlance this means doing
something in between which is typically easier to handle.

   It is very important to keep existing translations up-to-date with
the respective English originals.  This task should be higher priority
than translating new articles.  GNUN's `report' rule can help you to
identify precisely which articles need updating; *note report:
(gnun)report.  There is a monthly cronjob which sends a verbose output
to each team--by default, the address(es) used is the Savannah
account(s) of the admin(s) of the specific translation project.  If you
want them changed, please write to <web-translators@gnu.org>.

   It is strongly recommended translation teams to attempt to recruit
native English speakers in order to improve their translation process.
Translators sometimes misunderstand English idioms and expressions, and
as a result, they translate them incorrectly or in ways that are
suboptimal and confusing.  These errors are trivial to discover for the
native English speaker.

   _Do not_ translate articles under these directories:

`software/PKG/'
     These pages are maintained by the respective PKG maintainers.
     GNUN does not support them for the time being, as they reside in
     separate repositories.  The procedures for contributing
     translations of such articles are not yet settled.

`brave-gnu-world'
     The Brave GNU World initiative has been abandoned long time ago,
     and it's in a separate repository--thus not supported by the
     automatic GNUN build job.

`home.html'
     There is no problem to translate this page, but don't make the
     mistake to pick it up as your first translation.  It is modified
     often, sometimes intensively, and only active team members should
     take that road.

`server/whatsnew.html'
     This is "What's New", also known as "GNU's Flashes", also known as
     "GNU News".  It is deprecated since quite some time and translating
     it is discouraged.

5.5 When To CAPITALIZE
======================

The English language has some rules for capitalization of titles,
chapters, acronym expansions and the like.  These rules are neither
strict nor uniform, although the gnu.org website strives to apply them
consistently.  They do not make sense for many other languages, but
unfortunately, many translators _erroneously duplicate_ the
capitalization in their translation.

   Examples for common (and correct) English capitalization is the
title of the article "Why Software Should Be Free" or "Free Software
Foundation" (FSF).  However, in languages that do not have such grammar
rules it is wrong to write "Dlaczego Oprogramowanie Powinno Byc' Wolne"
(Polish) or "Fondation Pour Le Logiciel Libre" (French).

   Another prominent and widely spread mistake is to write your own
language with a capital letter in the `translations-list' when
languages are written beginning with a small letter according to your
own rules.  In other words, it is right to write `English' or `Deutsch'
(because in English and German languages are capitalized), but not
`Franc,ais' or `Portugue^s'--write them as `franc,ais' or `portugue^s',
respectively.

5.6 Distribution Terms
======================

Most www.gnu.org articles are released under the terms of the Creative
Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 United States license.  The exact HTML
for English pages to use is:

     This page is licensed under a <a rel="license"
     href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/">Creative
     Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 United States License</a>.

   Pages in other languages should translate this notice, and should
link to a translated version of the Creative Commons license "deed" if
it's available.  Creative Commons provides standard text for this in
all the languages they support, and we should use that wording whenever
possible.  To do that, follow these steps:

   * Check at the bottom of the English deed page to see the list of
     languages they support.  Follow the link the language that you
     want a translation for, if available.

   * Follow the "Use this license for your own work" link near the
     bottom of the translated deed page--it's in distinct yellow text.

   * The textarea on that page provides standard HTML.  Note that we're
     not using the graphic, just the text.


   For example, here's the text they provide for Dutch:

     Dit werk is gelicenseerd onder een <a rel="license"
     href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/deed.nl">
     Creative Commons Naamsvermelding-GeenAfgeleideWerken 3.0 Verenigde
     Staten licentie</a>

   Note that the link in this text is changed to point directly to the
Dutch language deed.  We should always link to a copy of the license
deed that's in the same language as the page itself.

   Pages in languages that aren't supported by CC should prepare their
own translation, use it consistently throughout pages translated to that
language, and link to the English language deed.  Also, please write
your own translation when the translation provided by CC is not
satisfactory for some reasons--for instance, as of May, 2012, their
German translation uses "Content", which is a word to use with caution
(see `http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.en.html#Content').

   Note that translations should _not_ change the jurisdiction of the
license; they should _always_ link to the CC BY-ND 3.0 _United States_
license, and _not_ a different port like CC BY-ND 3.0 Japan.  This is
because there are substantive differences between the way different
ports handle moral rights issues, and we prefer the specific terms that
are in the United States license.

5.7 Language-specific Terminology
=================================

This is a very important topic, not yet covered by this manual.

6 Overview Of The Translation Process
*************************************

In general, it is expected that all participants in the translation
process apply common sense for all of the decisions (important or not)
they are going to take in their capacity as a manager, team leader, or
contributing member.  Certainly, many decisions are not easy, and
require some thought.

   This manual is a work in progress--it is not set in stone, and it
will never be finished--the ultimate goal is to constantly improve the
translation process, and as a consequence, the documentation.  Every
participant in the process should be free to suggest modifications to
the current procedures and suggestions how to improve the current state
of affairs.  Ideally, they should be accompanied with patches to the
Texinfo source, but that's not mandatory.  In any event, please write
to <trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org>--the goal of this list is precisely to
discuss improvements of the translation process.

6.1 Related Mailing Lists
=========================

Here is a short summary of the mailing lists relevant to the translation
process, and a brief description about how they relate to the various
participants in the process.

<www-discuss@gnu.org>
     The basic discussion list of the GNU Webmasters.  All team leaders
     are required to subscribe.

     This is a private mailing list.

<www-commits@gnu.org>
     Commits to the `www' repository are sent here.  All Translation
     Managers are required to subscribe.  It is strongly recommended
     that team leaders subscribe--in any case they should, and mail
     delivery can be disabled personally.

     This is a public mailing list, so everyone can subscribe and
     review the archives.  The `www' CVS repository is also public.

<trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org>
     The main discussion list for the GNU Web Translators.  Team
     leaders must subscribe, as errors from GNUN are mailed here.
     Active team members are highly recommended to join as well,
     because the changes in general policies for translations are also
     announced and discussed here.

     This is a private mailing list.

<trans-coord-news@gnu.org>
     This is a list for notifications about gnunews and GNUnited Nations
     releases.  It is not mandatory to subscribe to it, although the
     traffic is very low.  If you want to track only GNUN release
     announcements, subscribe to the `gnun' topic via Mailman's user
     interface.  Likewise, if you want to receive only "What's New"
     updates, subscribe to the `whatsnew' topic.

     Automatic announcements for new gnu.org translations (provided
     they're handled by GNUN) are also delivered here.  There are
     separate `LANG-ann' topics for every GNUN-aware language, so it is
     a good idea to advertise this capability widely among your local
     community.  For example, if a reader wants to be informed only
     about new Spanish translations, she can just subscribe to the
     `es-ann' mailing list topic.

     This is a public mailing list.

<trans-coord-devel@gnu.org>
     All development of GNUN happens here.  Commits to the `trans-coord'
     repository are also sent to this list.

     This is a public list, and <bug-gnun@gnu.org> is an alias.

<trans-coord-logs@gnu.org>
     All build logs from the various GNUN automatic builds are sent to
     this list, so it is not a very pleasant thing to be subscribed,
     especially if you are not interested in GNUN's internals.
     However, everyone can use the web archives to check the log why a
     particular article was not built at expected.

     This is a public list.

6.2 Savannah Projects Membership
================================

Participants in the www.gnu.org translations process normally have to be
members of the following Savannah projects, depending on the case:

`www'
     The main project which hosts the `gnu.org' Web repository.
     Administrators are the Chief Webmaster, entrusted webmasters and
     the Translation Manager (in order to approve leader's
     applications).  All team leaders (and co-leaders) should be
     members of this project.

     Note that this project has no direct relationship with translators,
     although anything happening in `www' directly affects them.  The
     `www' project is managed separately and has a different (entirely
     unrelated) process for approving contributors.

`trans-coord'
     An organizational project especially created for coordination and
     improvement of the translation process.  All team leaders are
     required to be members, as bugs reported to
     <web-translators@gnu.org> are often redirected to the
     `trans-coord' `Bugs' tracker.

     The admins of this project are the GNU Web Translation Managers.

`www-LANG'
     All translation team leaders of the language LANG should be
     members of the project `www-LANG'.  The admins of the project are
     the team leader and the co-leaders, if any.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
