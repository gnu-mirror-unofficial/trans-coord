<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This manual is an attempt to describe in detail the process of
translating www.gnu.org articles&mdash;how to join a team, or start a new
one, the responsibilities of the team members and leaders, as well as
some peculiarities of the GNU Project&rsquo;s website when it comes to
localization.
</p>
<p>The GNU website contains hundreds of documents, most of them
philosophical articles (essays) and technical documents which need to be
translated to make them available to a broader audience.  This is
especially important for the philosophy-related materials, as many
people do not speak English and even those that do usually prefer to
read such articles in their native language.  Dealing with the task of
translating a website this large is a hard job, and too often people
volunteering as translators get frustrated or lose interest in keeping
up with that work.  Reading this manual, and the related GNUN manual
(see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#Top">GNUnited Nations</a> in <cite>The GNUnited Nations Manual</cite>), is
just the tip of the iceberg.  This is not meant to discourage any
potential volunteer; rather, we prefer to be honest and to give
preliminary estimation of the work/responsibility involved&mdash;if you feel
you are not in a position to help you may move on to a smaller project
before going through all procedures.
</p>
<p>It is important to realize that being a GNU Web Translator is a hard job
at all levels, but your help is much appreciated and is invaluable
contribution to the society.  While there are many people who contribute
to our community by writing free software (and their number is
constantly increasing), the ones actively engaged in teaching others to
appreciate and defend their freedom are only a few.  Consequently and
rather unfortunately, there are not so many volunteers willing to
maintain in the long term translations of the various essays that
describe the fundamental values of the free software movement.
</p>
<p>Translators of the <a href="http://gnu.org">http://gnu.org</a> website are organized in
language teams.  Each team has one or more co-ordinators, who are
responsible for the respective team; they are also referred to as
leaders or (when multiple in a single team) co-leaders.  The
co-ordinators participate in the Savannah &lsquo;<samp>trans-coord</samp>&rsquo;
organizational project, which is managed by the GNU Web Translation
Managers (also known as Translation Managers or web-translators).
The manual is organized in chapters that follow the
organizational structure of the whole translation project.
</p>
<p>If you wish to join a translation team or contribute a translation or
two, see <a href="#Members">Members</a>.  If your intention is to form a translation team,
see <a href="#Leaders">Leaders</a>.

<a name="Team-Members"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">2 Team Members</h2>

<p>Being a team member means to co-operate with a group of other people,
working under the co-ordinatorship of the appointed team leader.
Usually, this involves translating articles and reviewing/proof-reading
other people&rsquo;s translations, participating in discussions about
terminology issues, and sometimes performing clean-up tasks.

<a name="Joining-a-Team"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.1 Joining a Team</h3>

<p>To join a team, please first look at the existing teams at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.translations.html#TranslationsUnderway">http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.translations.html#TranslationsUnderway</a>.
Chances are that there is already an established team.  If there is no
team listed for your language, this means that:
</p>
<ul>
<li> There is no team established and there are no translations to this
language.

</li><li> Some translations were submitted by occasional contributors, but no team
has ever been formed.

</li><li> The page is not updated to reflect the current situation (this shouldn&rsquo;t
happen, but it&rsquo;s a possibility anyway).
</li></ul>

<p>If the team is marked as <em>orphaned</em> (&ldquo;New coordinator needed&rdquo;),
there is no problem: you can
still submit your translation to <a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>
(see <a href="#Submitting">Submitting</a>).  In case you want to establish a new translation
team or become a co-ordinator of an existing one, please refer to the
next chapter, see <a href="#Leaders">Leaders</a>.
</p>
<p>Contacting the team is best done via Savannah&mdash;each translation team
has its own project, named &lsquo;<samp>www-<var>lang</var></samp>&rsquo;, with the project
page being
&lsquo;<code>https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/www-<var>lang</var></code>&rsquo;.
All teams should have mailing lists, typically in the form
<a href="mailto:www-lang-&hellip;@gnu.org">www-<var>lang</var>-&hellip;@gnu.org</a>.  Some teams have homepages,
&lsquo;<code>http://gnu.org/server/standards/translations/<var>lang</var></code>&rsquo;
with additional contact details and procedures for team members.
</p>
<p>You could also write directly to the team leader via the Savannah
interface&mdash;that way your request will be recorded by Savannah and can be
tracked or completed when the membership is approved.
</p>
<p>The actual process of submitting translations for review varies from
team to team, as teams have certain liberties to organize themselves as
they see fit.  Thus, this manual does not make any attempt to cover that
aspect&mdash;please refer to the team-specific documentation (if any) or ask
the co-ordinator.
</p>
<p>Certainly, it is not mandatory to be an active team member to contribute
a translation or two.  If you feel that you don&rsquo;t have the time to
participate actively, that is fine; you can still send your translation
to the team.  No contributions should be rejected.
</p>
<p>If you do not hear from the team within a reasonable time frame (say,
two weeks), please write to <a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>.

<p>Everyone can still submit translations even if there is no translation
team formed.  There are two ways to do that&mdash;following the existing
procedures, which is the preferred way, and sending it as plain text,
which means more work for a limited group of volunteers (the Translation
Managers) to convert the translation in <samp>.po</samp> format.

<a name="How-to-Submit-a-Translation-in-PO-Format"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 How to Submit a Translation in PO Format</h4>

<p>All translations<a name="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a> are maintained via GNUN (see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnun/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gnun/</a>), which significantly eases
maintenance and avoids the unpleasant situation where a translation is
lagging behind the original.  See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#Advantages">Advantages</a> in <cite>The GNUnited
Nations Manual</cite>.
</p>
<p>Since September 2008 all new translations at gnu.org are installed in
<samp>.po</samp> format, and the <samp>.html</samp> is generated automatically.
Here are the steps to produce and submit such a translation:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Make a checkout of the CVS Web repository of the &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; Savannah
project.  You can find generic instructions at
<a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=www">https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=www</a>.  All updates to the
website are done as commits in the repository, so you would need an
up-to-date working copy.  Anonymous access works under any
circumstances, i.e. it is not mandatory to have a registered account at
Savannah to use it.  You can also check out only a specific directory,
for example:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/web/www co www/gnu
</pre></div>

<p>This command will fetch only the <samp>/gnu</samp> directory&mdash;in other words,
all articles at <a href="http://gnu.org/gnu">http://gnu.org/gnu</a>.
</p>
<p>You can also fetch single files by their respective URLs.  For example,
the URL for the template file of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a> is
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/po/free-sw.pot">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/po/free-sw.pot</a>; the URL for
its <var>lang</var> PO file (when available) is always
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/po/free-sw.lang.po">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/po/free-sw.lang.po</a>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">wget http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/po/free-sw.pot
</pre></div>

</li><li> Assuming you already know the article you want to translate, you have to
create an empty <samp><var>article</var>.<var>lang</var>.po</samp> file and then
translate all messages with a PO editor.  See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#New-Translation">New Translation</a> in <cite>The GNUnited Nations Manual</cite>.  For an almost complete list of PO
editors, see <a href="#PO-Files">PO Files</a>.

</li><li> When you are pleased with the translation, check that the PO file is
valid and submit it to <a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>, attached to
your message.  The web-translators will review (to the best of their
ability) the translation and will install it in the repository.

</li><li> In order for GNUN to be able to generate (and subsequently update) a fully
translated page, the language should have the server templates
available as PO files.  These templates are short, and translating them
shouldn&rsquo;t take much time.  If the language code is present in the
<code>TEMPLATE_LINGUAS</code> variable at <samp>server/gnun/gnun.mk</samp>, then you
don&rsquo;t have to do anything.  If it is not, the required files
are defined via the <code>extra-templates</code> variable
in <samp>server/gnun/gnun.mk</samp>&mdash;you can translate and
submit them in the usual way, together with the translation of the
essay.

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to translate the templates for whatever reason&mdash;do
not worry, the web-translators will install empty templates (which means
the English strings will be used).
</p></li></ul>

<p>It is quite possible that there will be errors or typos, so once you are
informed that the translation is online, check it carefully and if
necessary, resubmit the PO file with corrections.  Do not forget to run
<code>cvs update</code> first and edit the updated <samp>.po</samp> file from the
repository&mdash;most probably the Translation Managers have already made
some modifications to it, usually to fix validation errors and to
complete the PO file header.

<a name="How-to-Submit-a-Translation-as-Plain-Text"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.2.2 How to Submit a Translation as Plain Text</h4>

<p>If you feel the procedure described in the previous section is too
burdensome and unfeasible for you to follow, you can still submit a
translation in plain text.  It will be manually converted to PO file by
the GNU Web Translation Managers, which can be tricky sometimes, and
naturally, means more work for them and slower processing of your
request.
</p>
<p>You should <em>never</em> translate the HTML markup&mdash;i.e. <em>do not</em>
use the &ldquo;View Source&rdquo; functionality of your browser to translate the
raw HTML.  Most of it is irrelevant, and automatically inherited from
the markup of the original article.  Simply save your translation in a
plain text file (<samp>.txt</samp>), preferably in UTF-8 encoding.  You can
use any decent text editor for that&mdash;Emacs, Vim, gEdit, Kate,
LibreOffice (the file should be saved as <samp>.txt</samp>, not
<samp>.odt</samp>), etc.
</p>
<p>Translate the title, the blue heading (if it differs slightly from the
title) and the body of the article up to the link &lsquo;<samp>back to top</samp>&rsquo;.
For example, for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>
that would be:

<p>Since web-translators do not speak all languages, it is essential to
mark somehow any inner markup, because very often it is hard to figure
out what translated text should be enclosed inside <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements, to name a few.  The easiest way to do this is just
to use the corresponding HTML markup, although anything else is
suitable.  For example, here is how to indicate that the link &ldquo;History
section&rdquo; at the first paragraph of the same article should correspond
to &ldquo;secci&oacute;n historial&rdquo; in the translation:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Si quisiera revisar los cambios que hemos hecho, por favor vea la
{secci&oacute;n historial} m&aacute;s abajo para m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n.
</pre></div>

<p>It is not necessary to include the value of the <code>href</code> attribute,
as it is already known.
</p>
<p>If you wish your name to appear in the footer as a translator of the
article, please also provide a translation of &lsquo;<samp>Translation:
<var>your name in your native language</var></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>Translated by:
<var>your name in your native language</var></samp>&rsquo;, as you prefer.  Please also
state if you wish your email address to be published (some readers
prefer to send suggestions directly to the translator, but we certainly
do not require that translators must publish their address).
</p>
<p>Finally, send the translation to <a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>,
either inline or as an attachment to your message.  Once online, please
check for any errors or omissions that may have resulted from the
conversion process, and report them back.

<p>When you realize that you don&rsquo;t have time or can&rsquo;t devote sufficient
resources to perform the tasks anymore, it is prudent to inform the
translation team co-ordinator and possibly all the rest of the
team-mates.  The team leader should always have a rough estimation about
the available translators, even though there are no reliable means to
establish that.  Your announcement that you are stepping down
(temporarily or permanently) may help her in this regard.

<p>A gnu.org translation team leader is the person who is ultimately
responsible for organizing and managing the team, including, but not
limited to, having the final say on contributed translations and
exercising levels of control as she sees fit.
</p>
<p>A prospective team co-ordinator should have perfect understanding of the
GNU Philosophy and the various issues the free software movement set out
to solve.  Energy and time are always needed, as well as certain
communication skills.
</p>
<p>However, a team leader is not a dictator (for life); every action and
decision taken should have its justification and should stem from the
goals of the project at large.  Inefficient or inoperative leaders are
replaced, if necessary.

<h3 class="section">3.1 How to Form a New Team</h3>

<p>Establishing a new team is not hard, but a certain procedure ought to be
followed.  The most important thing to realize is that this is somewhat
a long-term engagement that requires a lot of spare time, communication
and technical skills, and devotion.  The only &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; team leaders
have is more work and more responsibilities.
</p>
<p>You should read <em>all</em> the documentation related to the
translation process and at the very least all important
philosophy-related articles listed at
<a href="http://gnu.org/server/standards/translations/priorities.html">http://gnu.org/server/standards/translations/priorities.html</a>
before you decide to form a new team, or take over an orphaned team.
Once you have the internal feeling that having a gnu.org translation
team for your language is a must, and you are the one for this job,
follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li> If you do not have a Savannah account, register at
<a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/account/register.php">https://savannah.gnu.org/account/register.php</a>.  Write access
to the repository and project membership is handled via Savannah, so you
would need an account in any case.

</li><li> Checkout a complete working copy of the CVS Web repository as described
at <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=www">https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=www</a>.  If you still
don&rsquo;t have a Savannah account or if you have registered one, but are not
yet member of any Savannah project, refer to the instructions under
&ldquo;Anonymous CVS Access&rdquo;.  If you are already a member of (any) Savannah
project, you can proceed with &ldquo;Project Member CVS Access via SSH&rdquo;,
although you will still lack permission to commit (later, when it is
granted, you can use the same working copy).

<p>Examine the layout and structure of the repository.  Basically, it is
mapped to the URL locations, more or less.  Take a look at the most
important materials to translate under <samp>/philosophy</samp>, <samp>/gnu</samp>,
<samp>/distros</samp>, <samp>/copyleft</samp> and <samp>/licenses</samp> directories just
to get a rough estimate about the amount of work involved<a name="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  If you are
still not scared and determined to go on further, excellent.
</p>
<p>As you have probably observed, every directory that contains
translatable articles has a <samp>/po</samp> sub-directory, which is where the
canonical source format of the translations is stored.
</p>
</li><li> Submit your first message stating that you would like to establish a new
team to <a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>; please mention that you have
read all the documentation and list the issues that remain unclear for
you.  The Translation Managers will answer your questions and send you
the standard questionnaire for new team leaders.  It is short and
shouldn&rsquo;t take more than 10&ndash;30 minutes to complete.  This questionnaire
is important, as we consider it crucial for any translation team
co-ordinator to have a good understanding of the philosophy of the free
software movement.

</li><li> Check if your language code is present in the variable
<code>TEMPLATE_LINGUAS</code> in the file <samp>server/gnun/gnun.mk</samp>.  If it
is not, the first thing to do is to translate and submit to
<a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a> the following files (all in the
<samp>server/po/</samp> directory):
<ul>
<li> <samp>head-include-2.<var>lang</var>.po</samp>

</li><li> <samp>body-include-1.<var>lang</var>.po</samp>

</li><li> <samp>body-include-2.<var>lang</var>.po</samp>

</li><li> <samp>bottom-notes.<var>lang</var>.po</samp>

</li><li> <samp>footer-text.<var>lang</var>.po</samp>

</li><li> <samp>outdated.<var>lang</var>.po</samp>

</li><li> <samp>skip-translations.<var>lang</var>.po</samp>

</li><li> <samp>top-addendum.<var>lang</var>.po</samp>
</li></ul>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#New-Translation">New Translation</a> in <cite>The GNUnited Nations Manual</cite>.
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- The language code (<var>lang</var>) should be the ISO 639-1 code of the
language, for example &lsquo;<samp>hy</samp>&rsquo; for Armenian or &lsquo;<samp>el</samp>&rsquo; for Greek.  If
the language is a variant such as Brazilian Portuguese or
Simplified Chinese, use small caps and a dash&mdash;&lsquo;<samp>pt-br</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>zh-cn</samp>&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;<samp>pt_BR</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>zh_CN</samp>&rsquo;.

</li><li>- The PO file header and initial comments should be completed as
documented.
</li></ul>

</li><li> Any prospective team leader should submit a few translations first.
This is a process of pointing errors and omissions (which are expected
and natural); it&rsquo;s an important thing to do as the leader is going to
carry out these checks on her own, once the team is approved.  If there
are existing translations that are not yet in PO format, the best thing
to do is to migrate one or two.  You can use <code>find</code> to find out
what&rsquo;s already in the repository, for example:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">find -name \*.<var>lang</var>.html
</pre></div>

</li><li> Submit at least two translations of your own.  We maintain a list with
priority articles at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/translations/priorities.html">http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/translations/priorities.html</a>,
although it is probably hard to start with one of them.  Choose whatever
you wish, provided it is an essay and not an auxiliary page.  Avoid
translating the homepage or <samp>planetfeeds.html</samp>&mdash;they are moving
targets and keeping up would be only a distraction for both parties in
the process.  As usual, send the completed translation to
<a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>.

</li><li> The Translation Managers will review your translations, and eventually
comment on them (mostly technical details if there is no one among them
speaking your language).  Depending on the case, it might be required to
submit a corrected file.  In any event, please take into account the
remarks in future work.

</li><li> If all goes well, you will receive a response inviting you to apply for
a new translation project at Savannah.  The project name should be
&lsquo;<samp>www-<var>lang</var></samp>&rsquo; where <var>lang</var> is, unsurprisingly, the language
code.  If such a project already exists, this step will be skipped and
you&rsquo;ll be made an administrator of the project and its mailing lists.
To register the
project, go to <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/register/">https://savannah.gnu.org/register/</a> and make sure
you fill in the required fields.  The &ldquo;Group type&rdquo; should be
&lsquo;<samp>www.gnu.org translation team</samp>&rsquo;, and &ldquo;Project
license&rdquo;&mdash;&lsquo;<samp>WebSite Only</samp>&rsquo;.  In the &ldquo;Tarball URL&rdquo; field enter a
bogus URL such as &lsquo;<samp>http://gnu.org</samp>&rsquo;.

<p><strong>Pay attention:</strong> This step is a formality.  You should proceed
with the project registration only when you have been asked by
<a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a> to do so.  Otherwise, the submission
may appear in the task list of the Savannah Hackers for a fairly long
time, which is troublesome.
</p>
</li><li> When the project is approved, the team information will be added to the
list at <samp>README.translations.html</samp>, you will become a member of the
&lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; project (thus granting you CVS write access to the whole
repository&mdash;so be careful) and the &lsquo;<samp>trans-coord</samp>&rsquo; project.  You&rsquo;ll
also be subscribed to the following mailing lists:

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- www-commits

</li><li>- trans-coord-discuss

</li><li>- www-discuss
</li></ul>

</li><li> When you are appointed the admin of the new project, please edit its
configuration; in particular, write its description, create a mailing
list (don&rsquo;t forget to subscribe yourself!), optionally add a home
page using Web CVS repository.

<p>If you are taking over an orphaned team, Translation Managers will
make you the owner of its mailing lists (if any).
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>The whole process should not take more than two weeks or maximum a
month&mdash;if this period turns out to be longer, it is an indication that
you do not have the required time and resources for this job, or
web-translators are badly lagging behind and do not process the requests
with the expected pace.
</p>
<p>Applications for new teams are sometimes processed in
parallel<a name="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a>&mdash;the
most suitable candidate is chosen in this case.  This is, undoubtedly,
based on a subjective judgment made by the Translation Managers, and
many factors are important.
</p>
<p>The procedure for taking over an orphaned team is the same.  Once
completed, you will be made an admin of the respective
&lsquo;<samp>www-<var>lang</var></samp>&rsquo; Savannah project, or if it doesn&rsquo;t exist, invited
to apply for registration.  Do not automatically remove old members just
because you are starting &ldquo;afresh&rdquo;&mdash;some of them might want to
continue to contribute.  Contact them privately, explaining that you&rsquo;re
the new appointed team co-ordinator, and ask them if they would be
willing to continue their involvement in the team.

<h3 class="section">3.2 The Gentle Art of Managing a Translation Team</h3>

<p>It is not our ambition to describe all activities involved in managing a
team&mdash;it&rsquo;s very likely that you will encounter new problems, take care
of tasks nobody else is aware of, or invent new techniques and
approaches in your quest to keep things running.  Managing a team is a
hard task on all counts: communication with others, recruiting
volunteers (and keeping them as long as possible), defending certain
decisions, leading discussions about terminology issues, handling
personal conflicts within the team, technical skills when
reviewing/merging/syncing translations, etc.  The list goes on and on.
</p>
<p>This manual can only summarize some of the most common issues and
<em>suggest</em> ways to deal with them.  It is up to the team leader to
establish the precise team procedures and practices.
</p>
<p>The <a href="mailto:trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org">trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org</a> mailing list was specifically
created to discuss issues that leaders encounter while managing the
teams, and for general organizational work.  Feel free to discuss
anything related to the translation process there.
</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that translation teams attempt to recruit
native English speakers in order to improve their translation process.
Translators sometimes misunderstand English idioms and expressions, and
as a result, they translate them incorrectly or in ways that are
suboptimal and confusing.  These errors are trivial to discover for the
native English speaker.

</div>
<a name="Peer-Review"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.3 Peer Review</h3>

<p>First and foremost, find at least one person for peer review.  You will
review her translations, and she will review yours (at least in the
beginning).  Being a team leader does not mean that you cannot make
mistakes; everyone does.  The mutual review (especially if done by a
larger group) is crucial for the quality of the translation process.
Too many errors are just missed (especially if they are obvious) when
the translator does a final review of her own translation.
</p>
<p>It is good to establish a practice: Do not commit officially (i.e. in
&lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo;, which will appear online at <a href="http://gnu.org">http://gnu.org</a>
immediately) a translation that is not yet reviewed by someone else who
is not the translator.  Always perform a final review yourself even if
the translation has been checked by another member of the team.  In
other words, every translation installed at gnu.org should pass through
your hands (read: eyes).
</p>
<p>One common technique for performing such reviews is to use a mailing
list&mdash;the translator sends the new translation and participants comment
on specific parts, quoting them appropriately.  The benefit of this
approach is that it is straightforward, but the drawback is that there
is no automatic &ldquo;record&rdquo; about the conclusion of the specific
discussion (or sub-thread) and sometimes such discussions easily
digress, making it even harder to come up with a solution.
</p>
<p>Another way is to use Savannah&rsquo;s built-in trackers (the &lsquo;<samp>Tasks</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>Bugs</samp>&rsquo; trackers, specifically).  This is further explained in the
next section, see <a href="#Tracking-Tasks">Tracking Tasks</a>.  One way or another, you should
create some kind of review process.

<a name="How-to-Track-Tasks-and-Bugs-Using-Savannah"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.3.1 How to Track Tasks and Bugs Using Savannah</h4>

<p>The team leader has to make sure that prospective translations are
reviewed, that they do not contain obvious errors and confusing
expressions and that they match the spirit and intention of the original
essay.  However, many teams tend to suffer from a specific problem: team
members rely on the leader to make these extensive reviews. That is
fine, as far as it goes, and the leader should always review
translations before installing them in the repository&mdash;but it is nearly
impossible (especially for a large team) to rely on a single person for
such tasks.  Team co-ordinators often do not manage to make such reviews
in time, resulting in frustration among the team members and generally
slowing the translation process.
</p>
<p>A solution to this specific problem is to distribute the load among more
people.  For example: Member D makes a translation of <samp>foo.html</samp>
and uploads <samp>foo.<var>lang</var>.po</samp> in the translation project&rsquo;s
repository at Savannah, marking the relevant task as &ldquo;Ready for Test&rdquo;
(of course, the equivalent is sending a message with the attached
translation to the team&rsquo;s mailing list, or similar).  Then Member A, B
and C (or only A and B if C is currently busy) review it independently
and post comments/suggestions/errors in the bug tracker.  Discussion
goes on between them and D, problems are rectified and finally the
leader (who may happen to be one of A, B, C, D) makes a final review.
It is easier to make the final review when most of the issues are
already fixed in previous revisions.  Finally, the translation is
published.  The result is better quality of the translation (since more
people looked at it) and the whole burden does not fall solely on the
shoulders of the leader.  You can also set up an internal formal rule:
If a member makes a translation, he has to review another one (or two)
as well.
</p>
<p>Some translations can take a fairly long time&mdash;the typical example is a
complicated essay or a transcript of a speech.  It is best to avoid
duplicate work by indicating, or better&mdash;recording, that someone is
working on this specific article.  The &lsquo;<samp>Tasks</samp>&rsquo; tracker is suitable
for this purpose.
</p>
<p>It is prudent to discuss the most convenient naming scheme and practice
among team members, and publish the convention or rules at the
team&rsquo;s homepage.  Note that you can create <em>Custom Fields</em> in the
trackers, and resolved bugs can be searched based on these custom
values.
</p>
<p>Thus, a possible straightforward way to manage these tasks is:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If someone starts working on a new translation, she creates a new task
with a &lsquo;<samp>Subject</samp>&rsquo; indicating the article, for example simply
&lsquo;<samp>philosophy/bsd.html</samp>&rsquo; and assigns it to herself.

</li><li> When the translation is finished and ready for review, the translator
changes the &lsquo;<samp>Status</samp>&rsquo; to &ldquo;Ready For Test&rdquo;.

</li><li> Other members review it, and open bugs relevant to one specific problem.
It is usually better not to conflate two different issues together&mdash;it
makes them harder to discuss, and hard to track them by severity.  Some
are grammatical errors, some are fundamental ones that change the whole
meaning, some are simply suggestions for improvement.  It helps if the
project admin creates new Category fields for every article, for
instance &lsquo;<samp>gnu/gnu-history.<var>lang</var>.html</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>philosophy/microsoft.<var>lang</var>.html</samp>&rsquo;&mdash;it would enable
functionality like &ldquo;Show me all bugs ever reported against this
translation&rdquo;, which is useful.

</li><li> Once the bugs (or at least the important bugs) are fixed, the team
leader can make the final review and install the translation in the
official repository, marking the task as &lsquo;<samp>Done</samp>&rsquo;.  Bugs that are not
resolved should remain open, naturally.
</li></ul>

<p>If there are compelling reasons, teams can choose to manage these
things using external
resources and eventually other bug (or issue) tracking systems.
Whatever you decide, please make sure that bugs can be reported using
free software only, and that the software providing that service is
free.  It makes an extremely bad impression if a reader has to report a
problem about a gnu.org translation via nonfree hosting platforms like
SourceForge.
</p>
<p>If you use a certain facility (i.e. a bug tracking system) to manage
bugs in translations, it is best to take advantage of
<samp>generic.<var>lang</var>.html</samp> and advertise it on every page.
See <a href="#generic_002ehtml">generic.html</a>, for details.

<h4 class="subsection">3.3.2 How to Proceed with Unreviewed Translations</h4>

<p>Sometimes a translation (typically your own) is not reviewed by anyone
else for a fairly long time.  This is unfortunate, but there is no
reason to keep it in draft state forever.  If nobody reviewed it for a
substantially long period (like 3 or 4 months), commit it as it is.
Readers may report bugs as well (and they do!).
</p>
<p>It is important to record somehow that this published translation still
lacks appropriate review.  If the suggestion in the previous section is
implemented, it would mean leaving the relevant task &lsquo;<samp>Open</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>Ready For Test</samp>&rsquo; despite the translation being officially online.
You may also add a comment to the PO file.

Versions System</a> in <cite>Version Management with CVS</cite>.  It is not
necessary to become an expert&mdash;the &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; project does not use
complex features like tags, vendor branches, merging, etc. as they are
not very useful for a live website.
</p>
<p>However, you&rsquo;d probably have to learn how to use CVS for effective
work&mdash;to extract information from the history, review diffs and
specific changes, synchronize with the working repository of the team
(if any), adding/removing files, etc.
</p>
<p>If you make changes that affect more than one file but the change is
coherent, please do it as a single commit.  This will generate only one
message to <a href="mailto:www-commits@gnu.org">www-commits@gnu.org</a>, which is better than 5 messages
for 5 files about semantically the same change.  Always write commit
logs in English<a name="DOCF4" href="#FOOT4"><sup>4</sup></a>, providing a short
description of the change.  If you modify a file that is not an article
but a script or part of software (such as <samp>server/gnun/gnun.mk</samp>),
it would be nice to follow the GNU Coding Standards and describe the
change precisely (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Change-Logs">Change Logs</a> in <cite>The GNU Coding Standards</cite>).  For example, do not write:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Added support for Nepali.
</pre></div>

<p>or
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Yay!  First commit of the Panjabi homepage!
</pre></div>

<p>Instead, write the log as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(TEMPLATE_LINGUAS): Add `ne'.
</pre></div>

<p>and
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(FUZZY_DIFF_LINGUAS): Add `pa'.
</pre></div>

<p>This makes it easier for others to search for a particular change in the
history.
</p>
<p>If you add a binary file (for example, <samp>.png</samp>), do it with
<code>cvs commit -kb <var>file</var></code>.  This turns off keyword substitution,
which prevents RCS keywords like &lsquo;<samp>$<!-- /@w -->Id$</samp>&rsquo; to get expanded,
subsequently corrupting the file.  See <a href="cvs.html#Substitution-Modes">Substitution Modes</a> in <cite>Version Management with CVS</cite>.  More importantly, using <samp>-kb</samp>
prevents corruption of the binary when people using CVS clients under
infamous OS checkout modify the file, and then commit it with
messed ends of lines.<a name="DOCF5" href="#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Although not absolutely compulsory, it is recommended that every team
leader subscribes to <a href="mailto:www-commits@gnu.org">www-commits@gnu.org</a>.  It is useful to
examine the diffs of your own messages, if you miss something while
inspecting the diff before the commit.  In any case, a team leader
should be subscribed to that list to avoid his own commit messages to be
moderated.  If you absolutely do not desire receiving all traffic, just
disable mail delivery in Mailman&rsquo;s user interface.

<a name="Taking-Advantage-of-Savannah"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.5 Taking Advantage of Savannah</h3>

<p>Every translation team should have a project in Savannah.  There are
some teams that use their own resources outside Savannah; although
there&rsquo;s no obligation to use Savannah for team work, the need for a
Savannah project for each language is obvious: it&rsquo;s a standard way to
find information for translation teams and their contacts.
</p>
<p>Using external hosting facilities may seem justified sometimes.  Some
teams may have already established repositories or bug tracking
systems where usual contributors already have access.  Some team
members prefer to work within the established infrastructure of a
broad translation team (for whatever reason), but this is discouraged.
It is required that every team has a mailing list at Savannah
(see <a href="#Savannah-Mailing-Lists">Savannah Mailing Lists</a>), because it is easier to pass its
management to the new co-ordinator when the old one steps down, and it
helps to keep the archives at one place for future members of the
team.  Likewise, it is better to use Savannah for the team&rsquo;s
repository and bugs/tasks, but this is not mandatory.
</p>
<p>However, it is important to remember that regardless of the technical
resources which a team decides to use, the responsibility of the team
co-ordinator remains the same.
</p>
<p>Those teams that are using Savannah have a broad variety of tools at
hand: team membership management, documents, trackers (bugs, tasks and
support), alerts, CVS (and any other VCS that Savannah supports), home
pages, etc.  How each team uses these resources is up to the team
itself, but it often turns out to choose Savannah for nearly all of
the team activities, as it requires almost zero work; the Savannah
Hackers are happy to support us.
</p>
<p>Whatever you (in your capacity as a team leader) decide, please do it
with caution: some organizational decisions may become ineffective as
time goes by, and some may not scale well when the team grows.  If the
team is young and has a couple of members, it is better to refrain from
such decision and discuss them with all the members when their number
grows.  Two or three people do not need a rocket platform or complex
wizardry to do their work.
</p>
<p>The next sections contain suggestions about how a team can use the
facilities provided by Savannah.  It is not mandatory to follow them,
they are just suggestions.

<h4 class="subsection">3.5.1 Managing Members</h4>

<p>You should add active translators as members of the translation team,
and remove them when they leave.  Team members should have access to all
of the project&rsquo;s resources, and tracking their number is one of the ways
for web-translators to determine the status of the team.
</p>
<p>It is OK if a particular contributor wants to translate an article or
two and does not want to be engaged with the team on a long-term basis.
In such situations, there is no need to add her as a member.
</p>
<p>It is a good idea to mark inactive members, for example if there is no
interaction (bug reports, new translations, updates to existing
translations, proof-reading) for at least six months.  You can do that
by unmarking the &lsquo;<samp>On Duty</samp>&rsquo; checkbox for the respective project
member under &lsquo;<samp>Set Permissions</samp>&rsquo;.  Inactive members have absolutely
the same rights as active ones&mdash;the only exception is that they don&rsquo;t
count for the total number of members, and they appear separately on
&lsquo;<samp>View Members</samp>&rsquo;.

<a name="Homepage-of-the-Team"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.5.2 Homepage of the Team</h4>

<p>Every Savannah project has a Web repository, which is, for technical and
historical reasons, only CVS.  By default it is mapped to
&lsquo;<code>http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/translations/<var>lang</var></code>&rsquo;;
to add files to it first make a checkout, following the instructions at
&lsquo;<code>https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=www-<var>lang</var></code>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>It is recommended to describe all team-specific procedures, if there are
any.  That way, you can point potential team members to the
corresponding page containing these instructions, instead of repeatedly
explaining every volunteer separately.
</p>
<p>All team-specific pages should follow the usual linking criteria (see
<a href="http://gnu.org/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#pollinking">http://gnu.org/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#pollinking</a>

is possible to use this tracker to &ldquo;announce&rdquo; to the team members that
a specific article should be translated.  The one who volunteers may
assign the task to herself.
</p>
<p>Teams may use this tracker to avoid duplicate work, by declaring that
they intend to work on a specific translation.

</p>
<p>You can also setup news entries to be sent to a mailing list (that&rsquo;s
possible for the other trackers as well).
</p>
<p>The purpose of this feature is informational&mdash;if members need to know
about an important change (in practices, procedures, etc.), it is

<a name="Managing-Mailing-Lists"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.5.7 Managing Mailing Lists</h4>

<p>Every team should have a mailing list on lists.gnu.org and use it for
internal communications.  All active translators should be on the
list.  The list owner should be the co-ordinator of the team.  The
name of the list should begin with &lsquo;<samp>www-<var>lang</var>-</samp>&rsquo;.  The team
co-ordinator is in the position to decide about the settings like
being public or private.
</p>
<p>The list will make it possible for the GNU project to contact the team
when the co-ordinator disappears; its archive will also give access to
the history for new translators.
</p>
<p>You can create new mailing lists via the Savannah interface.  However,
this should be done after some thought.  If the project membership is
low (&lt;= 10 members), there is no need to create more than one mailing
list.
</p>
<p>You can redirect all messages generated by the trackers to any list.

<h4 class="subsection">3.5.8 Version Control Systems</h4>

<p>An easy way to keep up with changes in the original articles and to
manage continuous contributions is to keep all translations in the
translation project&rsquo;s Sources repository.  That way, it is easy to edit
draft translations and install them in &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; only when they&rsquo;re
ready.  It is also convenient to update the translation (merge any
changes from the original) while it is still under review.
</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#Team_0027s-Repository">Team's Repository</a> in <cite>The GNUnited Nations Manual</cite>, for
more information.
</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> A choice of a particular VCS is a sensitive
matter&mdash;some modern ones provide compelling features, but they also
bump the barrier for participation higher.  The VCS is supposed to ease
collaborative maintenance&mdash;if it eases only you, project members just
won&rsquo;t use it so that won&rsquo;t be a net win.

<p>When the team grows large and it becomes hard for a single person to
manage, there is no problem to add another (or even two other) people
to help.  Note that a subsequently appointed team co-ordinator is not
simply a <em>committer</em> with write access to the &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; repository;
she has full responsibilities just like a single leader, although the
latter still remains the primary contact for the team.
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like another person to act as a co-leader and help you with the
management tasks, send a message to <a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>
with her name and Savannah account.  She has to be already
an administrator of &lsquo;<samp>www-<var>lang</var></samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The procedure for co-leaders is a simplified version of the one for a
new team or taking over an existing team.  See <a href="#New-Team">New Team</a>.
</p>
<p>To remove co-ordinators, please write to
<a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a> with details and rationale for the
removal.  Do not edit <samp>README.translations.html</samp> yourself; this is

<li> General information about the team&rsquo;s accomplishments during the past
year, like:

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- A list of new translations.

</li><li>- New members since the last report.

</li><li>- Solved problems and other issues, if any.  (Usual bug reports and other
improvements/fixes to the existing translations do not count as
<em>problems</em> in this sense.)

</li><li> Current active members.

</li><li> Current problems (technical or social), conflicts, and ideas for sorting
them out.

</li><li> Anything else you consider important or worth mentioning.
</li></ul>

<p>The best time to send a report is near the end of the year, for example
November.  In any case, please do not send it later than December 15th,
as the Translation Manager has to prepare a general report to the FSF,
and it is better if it takes into account the reports of the team
leaders.
</p>
<p>If there is no sensitive information in the report and you feel like
sharing it, you can send it to <a href="mailto:trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org">trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org</a>
(which is still a private mailing list).  That way, other list readers
may help with suggestions how to solve a particular issue.  Informing

<samp>education</samp>, <samp>distros</samp>,
<samp>copyleft</samp> and <samp>licenses</samp> are important.  The others may be

<h3 class="section">4.2 Keeping Translations Current</h3>

<p>It is very important to keep existing translations up-to-date with the
respective English originals.  This task should be higher priority than
translating new articles.  We developed various means to automate
the process of tracking outdated translations.
</p>
<ul>
<li> GNUN&rsquo;s <code>report</code> rule can help you identify precisely which
articles need updating; see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#report">report</a> in <cite>The GNUnited Nations
Manual</cite>.  There is a monthly cron job which sends the output of this
rule to each team as requested by their leaders.  If you want the
addresses changed, please write to <a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>.

</li><li> The <code>gnun-report</code> script produces a HTML page listing detailed
status of translations; see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#gnun_002dreport">gnun-report</a> in <cite>The GNUnited
Nations Manual</cite>.  A cron job commits updated reports for all active
teams to GNUN project web repository, typically twice an hour.  The
links to those reports are provided on
<a href="http://gnu.org/software/gnun/reports/">http://gnu.org/software/gnun/reports/</a>.

</li><li> GNUmakefile.team provides a more detailed <code>report</code> target: unlike
the output of the previous tools, it analyzes the status of files in
team&rsquo;s repository as well as of those in &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; repository;
see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#report-in-GNUmakefile_002eteam">report in GNUmakefile.team</a> in <cite>The GNUnited
Nations Manual</cite>.

</li><li> GNUmakefile.team also has a means to send more detailed reports
to specific translators; see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#notify-in-GNUmakefile_002eteam">notify in GNUmakefile.team</a> in <cite>The GNUnited Nations Manual</cite>.  The notification facility takes the
output of the <code>report</code> target, adds the URLs of relevant files,
and the results are sent with attached HTML files of
team&rsquo;s-against-&lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; differences to the translators who requested
tracking particular files.

<p>The feature is supposed to be invoked via a cron job; such jobs
already run for some teams on our server.  If you&rsquo;d like GNU Web
Translation Managers to setup a job for your team, please write to
<a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>.
</p>
</li><li> If your editors don&rsquo;t highlight differences against previous
messages, you may find it useful to track the changes in the messages
with <code>gnun-add-fuzzy-diff</code>.  For more details,
see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#gnun_002dadd_002dfuzzy_002ddiff">gnun-add-fuzzy-diff</a> in <cite>The GNUnited Nations Manual</cite>.

<h3 class="section">4.3 When to CAPITALIZE</h3>

<p>The English language has some rules for capitalization of titles,
chapters, acronym expansions and the like.  These rules are neither
strict nor uniform, although the gnu.org website strives to apply them
consistently.  They do not make sense for many other languages, but
unfortunately, many translators <em>erroneously duplicate</em> the
capitalization in their translation.
</p>
<p>Examples for common (and correct) English capitalization is the title of
the article &ldquo;Why Software Should Be Free&rdquo; or &ldquo;Free Software
Foundation&rdquo; (FSF).  However, in languages that do not have such grammar
rules it is wrong to write &ldquo;Dlaczego Oprogramowanie Powinno By&#263;
Wolne&rdquo; (Polish) or &ldquo;Fondation Pour Le Logiciel Libre&rdquo; (French).
</p>
<p>Another prominent and widely spread mistake is to write your own
language with a capital letter in the list of translations when
languages are written beginning with a small letter according to your
own rules<a name="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a>.  In other words, it is right to write
&lsquo;<samp>English</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>Deutsch</samp>&rsquo; (because in English and German
languages are capitalized), but not &lsquo;<samp>Fran&ccedil;ais</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>Portugu&ecirc;s</samp>&rsquo;&mdash;write them as &lsquo;<samp>fran&ccedil;ais</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>portugu&ecirc;s</samp>&rsquo;, respectively.

<p>Most www.gnu.org articles are released under the terms of
the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 United States license.
The exact HTML for English pages to use is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">This page is licensed under a &lt;a rel=&quot;license&quot;
href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/&quot;&gt;Creative
Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 United States License&lt;/a&gt;.
</pre></div>

<p>Pages in other languages should translate this notice, and should link
to a translated version of the Creative Commons license &ldquo;deed&rdquo; if it&rsquo;s
available.  Creative Commons provides standard text for this in all the
languages they support, and we should use that wording whenever
possible.  To do that, follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Check at the bottom of the English deed page to see the list of
languages they support.  Follow the link the language that you want a
translation for, if available.

</li><li> Follow the &ldquo;Use this license for your own work&rdquo; link near the bottom
of the translated deed page&mdash;it&rsquo;s in distinct yellow text.

</li><li> The textarea on that page provides standard HTML.  Note that we&rsquo;re not
using the graphic, just the text.

</li></ul>

<p>For example, here&rsquo;s the text they provide for Dutch:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Dit werk is gelicenseerd onder een &lt;a rel=&quot;license&quot;
href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/deed.nl&quot;&gt;
Creative Commons Naamsvermelding-GeenAfgeleideWerken 3.0 Verenigde
Staten licentie&lt;/a&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the link in this text is changed to point directly to the
Dutch language deed.  We should always link to a copy of the license
deed that&rsquo;s in the same language as the page itself.
</p>
<p>Pages in languages that aren&rsquo;t supported by CC should prepare their
own translation, use it consistently throughout pages translated to
that language, and link to the English language deed.  Also, please
write your own translation when the translation provided by CC is not
satisfactory for some reasons&mdash;for instance, as of May, 2012, their
German translation uses &ldquo;Content&rdquo;, which is a word to use with
caution (see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.en.html#Content">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.en.html#Content</a>).
</p>
<p>Note that translations should <em>not</em> change the jurisdiction of the
license; they should <em>always</em> link to the CC BY-ND 3.0 <em>United
States</em> license, and <em>not</em> a different port like CC BY-ND 3.0
Japan.  This is because there are substantive differences between the way
different ports handle moral rights issues, and we prefer the specific
terms that are in the United States license.

participants in the process.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><a href="mailto:www-discuss@gnu.org">www-discuss@gnu.org</a></dt>
<dd><p>The basic discussion list of the GNU Webmasters.  All team leaders are
required to subscribe.

</dd>
<dt><a href="mailto:www-commits@gnu.org">www-commits@gnu.org</a></dt>
<dd><p>Commits to the &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; repository are sent here.  All Translation
Managers are required to subscribe.  It is strongly recommended that
team leaders subscribe&mdash;in any case they should, and mail delivery can
be disabled personally.
</p>
<p>This is a public mailing list, so everyone can subscribe and review the
archives.  The &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; CVS repository is also public.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="mailto:trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org">trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org</a></dt>
<dd><p>The main discussion list for the GNU Web Translators.  Team leaders must
subscribe, as errors from GNUN are mailed here.  It&rsquo;s highly recommended
that active team members join as well, because the changes in general
policies for translations are also announced and discussed here.
</p>
<p>This is a private mailing list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="mailto:trans-coord-news@gnu.org">trans-coord-news@gnu.org</a></dt>
<dd><p>This is a list for notifications about gnunews and GNUnited Nations
releases.  It is not mandatory to subscribe to it, although the traffic
is very low.  If you want to track only GNUN release announcements,
subscribe to the &lsquo;<samp>gnun</samp>&rsquo; topic via Mailman&rsquo;s user interface.
</p>
<p>Automatic announcements for new gnu.org translations (provided they&rsquo;re
handled by GNUN) are also delivered here.  There are separate
&lsquo;<samp><var>lang</var>-ann</samp>&rsquo; topics for every GNUN-aware language, so it is a
good idea to advertise this capability widely among your local
community.  For example, if a reader wants to be informed only about new
Spanish translations, she can just subscribe to the &lsquo;<samp>es-ann</samp>&rsquo;
mailing list topic.

team leaders (and co-leaders) should be members of this project.
</p>
<p>Note that this project has no direct relation to translators,
although almost anything happening in &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; directly affects
them.  The &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; project is managed separately and has
a different (entirely unrelated) process for approving contributors.

<a name="Working-with-PO-Files"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.9 Working with PO Files</h3>
<a name="index-PO_002c-editing"></a>

<p>We anticipate that some gnu.org translators will find this format odd
or inconvenient, if they never happened to work with PO files
before<a name="DOCF7" href="#FOOT7"><sup>7</sup></a>.
Don&rsquo;t worry, you will soon get accustomed to it.  It is the
established format for translations in the Free World, and if you 
have any problems, other translators will help you.
</p>
<p>The most efficient way to edit a PO file is using a specialized PO
editor, because each of them represents and treats gettext messages in
a consistent and predictable way.  It is possible to edit a PO file
with an ordinary plain text editor, but extra effort would be
necessary to make it valid.
</p>
<p>Note that recent versions of some PO editors (both offline
and web-based) offer access to various translation services that
do machine translation for their users.  Using a machine translation
service is a clear example of SaaSS (see
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html</a>),
so please don&rsquo;t use such editors unless they only submit requests
to your (or GNU project&rsquo;s) own servers.
</p>
<p>Here is a list of widely used PO editors we can recommend:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a name="index-PO-editors"></a>
PO mode.  We recommend using GNU Emacs in PO mode, because Emacs is
the program that is suitable for performing any task when it comes to
maintaining the GNU Project&rsquo;s website.  Provided that you have GNU
gettext installed, any <samp>.po</samp> file you visit should automatically
switch to PO mode.  You can enable/disable it with <code>M-x po-mode
<span class="key">RET</span></code>.  On some GNU/Linux distros such as gNewSense, PO mode is
available in a separate package, <code>gettext-el</code>.
See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#PO-Mode">Emacs&rsquo;s PO File Editor</a> in <cite>GNU gettext tools</cite>.

</li><li> Gtranslator&mdash;the GNOME PO editor.  See
<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gtranslator/">http://projects.gnome.org/gtranslator/</a>.

</li><li> Lokalize&mdash;the KDE 4 editor.  See
<a href="http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize">http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize</a>.

</li><li> KBabel&mdash;the KDE 3 editor.  No longer supported, but might be
available on some old systems.

</li><li> Poedit&mdash;another popular editor that is based on the <code>wxWidgets</code>
graphical toolkit.  See <a href="http://www.poedit.net">http://www.poedit.net</a>.

</li><li> po.vim&mdash;ftplugin for the Vim editor.  The best option for people who
use Vim as their editor.  See
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2530">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2530</a>.

</li><li> Various web-based editors.
</li></ul>

<a name="Web_002dbased-Systems"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.9.1 Web-based Systems</h4>

<p>An alternative way to maintain translations is to use one of the
existing online editors.  There are plans to install a web-based system
for managing <samp>.po</samp> files at Savannah, including online editing and
statistics.  Until it happens, teams who wish to use this functionality
may setup such a server on a host of their own, or use one of the
existing free hosting platforms such as Launchpad
(<a href="http://translations.launchpad.net">http://translations.launchpad.net</a>).
</p>
<p>Here is a short and probably incomplete list of such systems:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Vertaal&mdash;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/vertaal">http://code.google.com/p/vertaal</a>

</li><li> Narro&mdash;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/narro">http://code.google.com/p/narro</a>

</li><li> Launchpad&mdash;<a href="https://dev.launchpad.net">https://dev.launchpad.net</a>

</li></ul>

<p>If you decide to use such a system, please make sure that no
translations are published in HTML format there.
</p>
<p>Note that to keep the <samp>.pot</samp> files regularly updated (assuming such
a web-based system runs <code>msgmerge</code> automatically), you&rsquo;ll have
to take care of the one-way regular sync from the &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo; CVS
repository.

<p>Migration to the new style should be straightforward, and this is one of
the problems GNUN set out to solve.  If you have to migrate old-style
translations, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#Migrating">Migrating</a> in <cite>The GNUnited Nations Manual</cite>.
If the old translation is HTML 2.0 (or 3.2), you still have to take care
about the inner markup.  Overall, it is substantially easier than doing
all of it manually.
</p>
<p>Subsequent migrations to newer HTML standards and newer look and feel
of the website are supposed to happen semi-automatically, although
this manual will be updated as needed.

GNUN&rsquo;s control (there are no translatable strings).  Remember to specify
the proper <code>xml:lang</code> and <code>lang</code> attributes, and for RTL
languages, the <code>dir</code> attribute.  For example, the file
<samp>header.ar.html</samp> should contain this line:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;ar&quot; lang=&quot;ar&quot;
      dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><samp>server/head-include-1.html</samp></dt>
<dd><p>This file (included from <samp>server/header.html</samp>) is very important:
the encoding is defined here.  Even if a specific PO file is
deliberately encoded in another encoding, the generated HTML will
contain the encoding declared in the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element at
<samp>server/head-include-1.<var>lang</var>.html</samp>, so browsers will obey it.
</p>
<p>The encoding must be UTF-8, because the English text in the
&ldquo;no-grace&rdquo; articles serves as a replacement of the translation when
the latter is not complete, and because all translated pages share
automatically generated lists of translations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>server/html5-header.html</samp></dt>
<dd><p>This file is included in pages using some entities introduced
in HTML5 draft.  We have to distinguish those pages since some features
of HTML4 were rejected in HTML5, and our old pages don&rsquo;t validate
as HTML5.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>server/html5-head-include-1.html</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Likewise, this file replaces head-include-1.html for HTML5 pages.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>server/head-include-2.html</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Imports the standard CSS, which can be overridden.  See <a href="#CSS">CSS</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>server/footer.html</samp></dt>
<dd><p>This is a very short and simple file (at least at the time of writing),
containing another <code>#include</code> directive.  It is maintained
manually, so just add <var>lang</var> to the filename, in order the localized
<samp>footer-text.<var>lang</var>.html</samp> to be included.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>server/outdated.html</samp></dt>
<dd><p>This file is automatically included in outdated translations.  It
contains respective message with links to the English file and
to a generated difference of the current revision of the English
file against the most recent revision that has a complete translation.
It is only included in articles affected by &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; because
in those cases the outdated passages are replaced with English text,
and it is evident without any notices that there is no complete
and up to date translation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>server/skip-translations.html</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The text for a link to the end of the autogenerated list of
translations.  It is not actually used as of January 2014.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>server/top-addendum.html</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The text saying that the page is a translation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>licenses/gpl-3.0-body.html</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>licenses/fdl-1.3-body.html</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>&hellip;</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Some of the licenses have the text of the license itself separated in
another file.  This serves two purposes: 1) to provide a &ldquo;standalone&rdquo;
HTML version of the license without the gnu.org style; 2) to prevent
strings sneaking in the <samp>.pot</samp> files, as licenses have only
unofficial translations, hosted elsewhere.  Nothing special should be
done about these SSI directives; the files generated by GNUN include
them verbatim as they should not be translated.

<p>in the <samp>server</samp> sub-directory are what webmasters call &ldquo;the
server templates&rdquo;.  These files are included in almost every article,
translated or not.  They are somewhat important, as an error made in
translating them may break every translated page.  The server
templates and the homepages are rebuilt by GNUN whenever the original
English files change; the <code>GRACE</code> variable has no effect on them.

<a name="How-to-Use-Custom-CSS"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.12 How to Use Custom CSS</h3>

<p>The CSS file <samp>layout.css</samp> gets included (with three other CSS files)
in almost all the English articles through
<samp>server/head-include-2.<var>lang</var>.html</samp>.  However, sometimes this
style isn&rsquo;t quite right for translations&mdash;many languages have much
longer expressions, and that is natural.  To include your own CSS,
create a file <samp>style.<var>lang</var>.css</samp> and add it <em>after</em> the
directive to include <samp>server/head-include-2.<var>lang</var>.html</samp> and
<em>before</em> the closing <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag in
<samp>server/banner.<var>lang</var>.html</samp>, i.e.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;!-- start of banner.bg.html --&gt;
&lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;/server/head-include-2.bg.html&quot; --&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/style.bg.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Override only what is necessary and looks broken in your language; do
not invent your own style.  This is important for the consistency of the
gnu.org website.  A typical language-specific
<samp>style.<var>lang</var>.css</samp> file looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">.inner { max-width: 85em; }

#logo{background:url(/graphics/topbanner.bg.png) no-repeat;}
#fssbox {font-size: 50%;}
</pre></div>

<p>This widens the menu and the area where the articles are displayed
(because the menu entries are <em>much</em> longer than the English
equivalents when translated), includes a localized logo, and makes the
font size for the FSF widget twice smaller (because in this language,
the translations are almost twice longer and displayed truncated, which
is undesirable).
</p>
<p>When creating your own <samp>style.<var>lang</var>.css</samp>, don&rsquo;t forget to
include the license notice from the <samp>layout.css</samp>, with a short
comment.
</p>
<p>If using the default CSS style for translations does not give the
expected good results, or there are other problems (significant or not)
that obstruct reading or worsen the look from an aesthetic point of
view, please write to <a href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">webmasters@gnu.org</a> with a description of
the issue.  If there are several unrelated problems, send separate
messages with appropriate explanation (which may include a demonstration
of the bug, such as a screenshot).

<p>If you&rsquo;d like the nice gnu image to be localized (i.e. &ldquo;GNU Operating
System&rdquo; to appear in your native language, here are the steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Copy <samp>graphics/topbanner.svg</samp> as
<samp>graphics/topbanner.<var>lang</var>.svg</samp> where <var>lang</var> is the
language code, as usual.  Edit the file with Inkscape or with a plain
text editor such as GNU Emacs, translating &ldquo;GNU Operating System&rdquo;.
Then with Inkscape, save the file as
<samp>graphics/topbanner.<var>lang</var>.png</samp> (File -&gt; Export Bitmap&hellip;).
Then open the PNG image with the GIMP and flatten it (Image -&gt; Flatten
Image).  Don&rsquo;t forget to save and <code>cvs add</code> the files<a name="DOCF8" href="#FOOT8"><sup>8</sup></a>.

</li><li> Create a <samp>style.<var>lang</var>.css</samp> at the toplevel directory, if it
doesn&rsquo;t exist already.  Normally, you would need only one line in it,
namely:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#logo{background:url(/graphics/topbanner.<var>lang</var>.png) no-repeat;}
</pre></div>

</li><li> If not done already for other reasons, update
<samp>banner.<var>lang</var>.html</samp> to include the language specific
<samp>style.<var>lang</var>.css</samp>.  See <a href="#CSS">CSS</a>.
</li></ol>

<p>If you feel uncomfortable manipulating images&mdash;don&rsquo;t despair!  Send a
plea for help to <a href="mailto:trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org">trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org</a>, some people would
be happy to help you.  Failing that, write to

<h4 class="subsection">4.12.2 Specific Issues Related to RTL</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="http://gnu.org">http://gnu.org</a> website does not have excellent
support for RTL (right-to-left) languages, although best efforts are
made.  If your language is in this category, make sure to:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Set the attribute <code>dir=&quot;rtl&quot;</code> in the <code>html</code> element at
<samp>server/header.<var>lang</var>.html</samp>.

</li><li> You <em>must</em> have a custom CSS to override some of the pre-defined
values.  See <samp>style.ar.css</samp> and <samp>style.fa.css</samp> to understand
how these two languages solve some of the problems.  See <a href="#CSS">CSS</a>.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Some articles contain their own <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
redefinitions, or style attributes in the form <code>&lt;p
style=&quot;&hellip;&quot;&gt;</code>.  In such situations, it is quite possible that the
general language-specific CSS does not help, and the translation of this
specific article does not look correct.  Please write to
<a href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">webmasters@gnu.org</a>; if you have a working solution that works
for both cases&mdash;so much the better.  For general issues that affect
your language and require a general solution, write to
<a href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">webmasters@gnu.org</a> as well, precisely describing the problem.

<a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre></div>

<ol>
<li> PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
</li><li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.
</p>
<p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li><li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li><li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li><li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li><li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li><li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li><li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li><li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li><li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li><li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document&rsquo;s license notice.

</li><li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li><li> Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li><li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li><li> For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li><li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li><li> Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li><li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li><li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li><li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;
</p>
</li><li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li><li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li><li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</p>
</li><li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</p>
</li><li> RELICENSING

<p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</p>
<p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with&hellip;Texts.&rdquo; line with this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
</p>

<p>Well&mdash;not really, but the goal is to maintain
all of them.</p>
<h3><a name="FOOT2" href="#DOCF2">(2)</a></h3>
<p>As of
December 2013, there are over 250 files to translate in &ldquo;important&rdquo;
directories; their volume is about 4 MB.</p>
<h3><a name="FOOT3" href="#DOCF3">(3)</a></h3>
<p>In general, we try to avoid this and direct all new
volunteers to the person who is already carrying out the process&mdash;this
is also a verification if she can co-operate easily with others.</p>
<h3><a name="FOOT4" href="#DOCF4">(4)</a></h3>
<p>This advice is applicable for the &lsquo;<samp>www</samp>&rsquo;
repository only&mdash;feel free to write logs in your native language when
committing in your team&rsquo;s repositories.</p>
<h3><a name="FOOT5" href="#DOCF5">(5)</a></h3>
<p>Few years ago there still were
committers using nonfree operating systems&mdash;we don&rsquo;t dictate what
OS people use, but we can at least prevent this technical kind
of damage.</p>
<h3><a name="FOOT6" href="#DOCF6">(6)</a></h3>
<p>The lists of translations are generated
automatically.  The names of the languages are defined in a specific
file, languages.txt (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/gnun.html#languages_002etxt">languages.txt</a> in <cite>The GNUnited
