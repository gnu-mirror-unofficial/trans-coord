<h4 class="subsection">3.2.2 CVS Commits And Best Practices</h4>

<p>As all team leaders have write access to the CVS repository of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">www</span></samp>&rsquo; project, this technically means that they are able to modify
every single file in it, and also those of the Web CVS repositories of
other projects at Savannah.  This vote of confidence should never be
abused&mdash;the only files team co-ordinators should add/update are those
relevant to their translation work.  It is OK to fix an obvious typo in
an original article; for anything else please report to
<a href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">webmasters@gnu.org</a>.

   <p>If you wish to volunteer as webmaster and help with generic webmaster
work and RT tickets, that is perfectly fine&mdash;please follow the
established (by the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Webmasters) procedure.  If you are
approved, you can modify such pages wearing your &ldquo;webmaster's hat&rdquo;.

   <p>If a particular page has issues with the markup which create problems
for your language, please inform <a href="mailto:trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org">trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org</a>. 
For general issues that affect more articles, or for severe problems,
please write to <a href="mailto:www-discuss@gnu.org">www-discuss@gnu.org</a>.

   <p>It is recommended to read the entire CVS manual at least once, for a
basic understanding of how this VCS works.  See <a href="../cvs/index.html#Top">Concurrent Versions System</a>.  It is not
necessary to become an expert&mdash;the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">www</span></samp>&rsquo; project does not use
complex features like tags, vendor branches, merging, etc. as they are
not very useful for a live website.

   <p>However, you'd probably have to learn how to use CVS for effective
work&mdash;to extract information from the history, review diffs and
specific changes, synchronize with the working repository of the team
(if any), adding/removing files, etc.

   <p>If you make changes that affect more than one file but the change is
coherent, please do it as a single commit.  This will generate only one
message to <a href="mailto:www-commits@gnu.org">www-commits@gnu.org</a>, which is better than 5 messages
for 5 files about semantically the same change.  Always write commit
logs in English<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, providing a short
description of the change.  If you modify a file that is not an article
but a script or part of software (such as <samp><span class="file">server/gnun/gnun.mk</span></samp>),
it would be nice to follow the GNU Coding Standards and describe the
change precisely.  For example, do not write:

<pre class="example">     Added support for Nepali.
</pre>
   <p>or

<pre class="example">     Yay!  First commit of the Panjabi homepage!
</pre>
   <p>Instead, write the log as follows:

<pre class="example">     (TEMPLATE_LINGUAS): Add `ne'.
</pre>
   <p>and

<pre class="example">     (HOME_LINGUAS): Add `pa'.
</pre>
   <p>This makes it easier for others to search for a particular change in the
history.

   <p>If you add a binary file (for example, <samp><span class="file">.png</span></samp>), do it with
<code>cvs commit -kb </code><var>file</var>.  This turns off keyword substitution,
which prevents RCS keywords like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$<!-- /@w -->Id$</span></samp>&rsquo; to get expanded,
subsequently corrupting the file.  See <a href="../cvs/Substitution-Modes.html#Substitution-Modes">Substitution Modes</a>.  More importantly, using <samp><span class="option">-kb</span></samp>
prevents corruption of the binary when people using CVS clients under
Windoze checkout, modify the file, and then commit it with messed EOLs. 
(Unfortunately there are still committers using non-free operating
systems&mdash;we cannot dictate what OS people use, but we can at least try
to prevent damage.)

   <p>Although not absolutely compulsory, it is recommended that every team
leader subscribes to <a href="mailto:www-commits@gnu.org">www-commits@gnu.org</a>.  It is useful to
examine the diffs of your own messages, if you miss something while
inspecting the diff before the commit.  In any case, a team leader
should be subscribed to that list to avoid his own commit messages to be
moderated.  If you absolutely do not desire receiving all traffic, just
disable mail delivery in Mailman's user interface.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> This advice is applicable for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">www</span></samp>&rsquo;
repository only&mdash;feel free to write logs in your native language when
committing in your project's Sources repository.</p>
