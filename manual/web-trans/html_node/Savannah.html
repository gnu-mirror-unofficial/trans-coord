<h4 class="subsection">3.2.3 Taking Advantage of Savannah</h4>

<p>Every translation team should have a project in Savannah.  There are
some teams that use their own resources outside from Savannah; although
there's no obligation to use Savannah for team work, the need for a
Savannah project for each language is obvious: it's a standard way to
find information for translation teams and their contacts.

   <p>Using external hosting facilities may seem justified sometimes.  Some
teams may have already established repositories and/or bug tracking
systems where usual contributors already have access.  Some team
members prefer to work within the established infrastructure of a
broad translation team (for whatever reason), but this is discouraged. 
It is required that every team has a mailing list at Savannah
(see <a href="Savannah-Mailing-Lists.html#Savannah-Mailing-Lists">Savannah Mailing Lists</a>), because it is easier to pass its
management to the new co-ordinator when the old one steps down, and it
helps to keep the archives at one place for future members of the
team.  Likewise, it is better to use Savannah for the team's
repository and bugs/tasks, but this is not mandatory.

   <p>However, it is important to remember that regardless of the technical
resources which a team decides to use, the responsibility of the team
co-ordinator remains the same.

   <p>Those teams that are using Savannah have a broad variety of tools at
hand: team membership management, documents, trackers (bugs, tasks and
support), alerts, CVS (and any other VCS that Savannah supports), home
pages, etc.  How each team uses these resources is up to the team
itself, but it often turns out to choose Savannah for nearly all of
the team activities, as it requires almost zero work; the Savannah
Hackers are happy to support us.

   <p>Whatever you (in your capacity as a team leader) decide, please do it
with caution: some organizational decisions may become ineffective as
time goes by, and some may not scale well when the team grows.  If the
team is young and has a couple of members, it is better to refrain from
such decision and discuss them with all the members when their number
grows.  Two or three people do not need a rocket platform or complex
wizardry to do their work.

   <p>The next sections contain suggestions about how a team can use the
facilities provided by Savannah.  It is not mandatory to follow them,
they are just suggestions.
