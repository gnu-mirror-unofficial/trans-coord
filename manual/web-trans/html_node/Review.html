<h4 class="subsection">3.2.1 Peer Review</h4>

<p>First and foremost, find at least one person for peer review.  You will
review her translations, and she will review yours (at least in the
beginning).  Being a team leader does not mean that you cannot make
mistakes; everyone does.  The mutual review (especially if done by a
larger group) is crucial for the quality of the translation process. 
Too many errors are just missed (especially if they are obvious) when
the translator does a final review of her own translation.

   <p>It is good to establish a practice: Do not commit officially (i.e. in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">www</span></samp>&rsquo;, which will appear online at <a href="http://gnu.org">http://gnu.org</a>
immediately) a translation that is not yet reviewed by someone else who
is not the translator.  Always perform a final review yourself even if
the translation has been checked by another member of the team.  In
other words, every translation installed at gnu.org should pass through
your hands (read: eyes).

   <p>One common technique for performing such reviews is to use a mailing
list&mdash;the translator sends the new translation and participants comment
on specific parts, quoting them appropriately.  The benefit of this
approach is that it is straightforward, but the drawback is that there
is no automatic &ldquo;record&rdquo; about the conclusion of the specific
discussion (or sub-thread) and sometimes such discussions easily
digress, making it even harder to come up with a solution.

   <p>Another way is to use Savannah's built-in trackers (the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Tasks</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Bugs</span></samp>&rsquo; trackers, specifically).  This is further explained in the
next section, see <a href="Tracking-Tasks.html#Tracking-Tasks">Tracking Tasks</a>.  One way or another, you should
create some kind of review process.
