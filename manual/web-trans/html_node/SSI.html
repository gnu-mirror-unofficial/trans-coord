<h3 class="section">5.2 Summary of SSI <code>#include</code>s</h3>

<p>The GNU Project's website uses SSI (Server Side Includes) to manage some
common parts that are the same in many of the articles.  With the help
of GNUN their handling should be behind the scenes, but for some of them
manual intervention is needed.  Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of
the <code>#include</code>'s used:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">server/banner.html</span></samp><dd>This file contains only <code>#include</code> directives, so the
&ldquo;translation&rdquo; should be identical, with filenames modified to have the
<var>lang</var> extension.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/body-include-1.html</span></samp><dd>Contains the top menu with useful &ldquo;skip to&rdquo; links.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/body-include-2.html</span></samp><dd>This is the file containing the menus, the FSF widget, and any visible
announcements made from time to time.  If a string gets &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; or
&ldquo;new&rdquo; here, it will appear in English in all translations, until
<samp><span class="file">server/po/body-include-2.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp> is updated.  Note that
some validation errors originate from an error in
<samp><span class="file">server/body-include-2.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> or some other template
file.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/footer-text.html</span></samp><dd>This is a very short file currently containing the &ldquo;back to top&rdquo; link. 
Also translatable via GNUN.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/header.html</span></samp><dd>The declaration that is included in literally every file.  It is
maintained manually, as it does not make much sense to put it under
GNUN's control (there are no translatable strings).  Remember to specify
the proper <code>xml:lang</code> and <code>lang</code> attributes, and for RTL
languages, the <code>dir</code> attribute.  For example, the file
<samp><span class="file">header.ar.html</span></samp> should contain this line:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="ar" lang="ar"
                dir="rtl"&gt;
</pre>
     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/head-include-1.html</span></samp><dd>This file (included from <samp><span class="file">server/header.html</span></samp>) is very important:
the encoding is defined here.  Note that it is applicable for all
translations, so it is not possible to have different articles in
different encodings.  Even if a specific PO file is deliberately encoded
in another encoding, the generated HTML will contain the encoding
declared in the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element at
<samp><span class="file">server/head-include-1.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>, so browsers will obey it.

     <p>The encoding should be UTF-8.  This is required because the English text
in the articles serves as a replacement of the translation when the latter
is not complete, and because all translated pages share automatically
generated lists of translations.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/html5-header.html</span></samp><dd>This file is included in newer pages using some entities introduced
in HTML5 draft.  We have to distinguish those pages since some features
of HTML4 were rejected in HTML5, and our old pages don't validate
as HTML5.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/html5-head-include-1.html</span></samp><dd>Likewise, this file replaces head-include-1.html for HTML5 pages.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/head-include-2.html</span></samp><dd>Imports the standard CSS, which can be overridden.  See <a href="CSS.html#CSS">CSS</a>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/footer.html</span></samp><dd>This is a very short and simple file (at least at the time of writing),
containing another <code>#include</code> directive.  It is maintained
manually, so just add <var>lang</var> to the filename, in order the localized
<samp><span class="file">footer-text.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> to be included.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/outdated.html</span></samp><dd>This file is automatically included in outdated translations.  It
contains respective message with links to the English file and
to a generated difference of the current revision of the English
file against the most recent revision that has a complete translation. 
It is only included in articles affected by &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; because
in those cases the outdated passages are replaced with English text,
and it is evident without any notices that there is no complete
and up to date translation.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">translations.include</span></samp><dd>The list of translations for the homepage (and only the homepage).  It
is maintained manually; in order the link to a translation to appear on
all of the homepages, it has to be present here.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.include</span></samp><dd>A portion of the most recent 3 news items from
<samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.html</span></samp>, generated automatically.  If your language
does not have <samp><span class="file">server/po/whatsnew.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>, this file will be
used.  Otherwise, if there is an existing localized homepage and you
commit <samp><span class="file">whatsnew.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>, the homepage will be rebuilt to
include the translated <samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.include</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.include</span></samp><dd>Generated automatically, this file is included from
<samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.html</span></samp>.  Translations are built automatically, and
the localized <samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.include</span></samp> is derived from it.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">licenses/gpl-3.0-body.html</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="file">licenses/fdl-1.3-body.html</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="file">...</span></samp><dd>Some of the licenses have the text of the license itself separated in
another file.  This serves two purposes: 1) to provide a &ldquo;standalone&rdquo;
HTML version of the license without the gnu.org style; 2) to prevent
strings sneaking in the <samp><span class="file">.pot</span></samp> files, as licenses have only
unofficial translations, hosted elsewhere.  Nothing special should be
done about these SSI directives; the files generated by GNUN include
them verbatim as they should not be translated.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">server/sidebar*.html</span></samp><dd>These files are deprecated&mdash;they are remnants from an older design that
lived shortly in the middle between the old classic design and the
current one.  If all translations are successfully migrated and none of
them includes such files, you should delete them.  You can use
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> to check this. 
</dl>

   <p>The files

<!-- Use @itemize to avoid `underfull \hbox' warnings from TeX. -->
     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="file">header.html</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">head-include-1.html</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">html5-header.html</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">html5-head-include-1.html</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">head-include-2.html</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">banner.html</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">body-include-1.html</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">body-include-2.html</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">footer.html</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">footer-text.html</span></samp>
</ul>

   <p>in the <samp><span class="file">server</span></samp> sub-directory are what webmasters call &ldquo;the
server templates&rdquo;.  These files are included in almost every article,
translated or not.  They are somewhat important, as an error made in
translating them propagates everywhere.  The server templates, the
homepages, and whatsnew (a.k.a. &ldquo;GNU News&rdquo;) are being rebuilt by
GNUN whenever there is a change in the original English files; the
<code>GRACE</code> variable has no effect for them.  See <a href="../gnun/Runtime-Variables.html#Runtime-Variables">Runtime Variables</a>.
