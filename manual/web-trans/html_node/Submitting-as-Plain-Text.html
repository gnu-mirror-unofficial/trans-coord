<h4 class="subsection">2.2.2 How To Submit a Translation as Plain Text</h4>

<p>If you feel the procedure described in the previous section is too
burdensome and unfeasible for you to follow, you can still submit a
translation in plain text.  It will be manually converted to PO file by
the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Web Translation Managers, which can be tricky
sometimes, and naturally, means more work for them and slower processing
of your request.

   <p>You should <em>never</em> translate the HTML markup&mdash;i.e. <em>do not</em>
use the &ldquo;View Source&rdquo; functionality of your browser to translate the
raw HTML.  Most of it is irrelevant, and automatically inherited from
the markup of the original article.  Simply save your translation in a
plain text file (<samp><span class="file">.txt</span></samp>), preferably in UTF-8 encoding.  You can
use any decent text editor for that&mdash;Emacs, Vim, gEdit, Kate,
OpenOffice.org (the file should be saved as <samp><span class="file">.txt</span></samp>, not
<samp><span class="file">.odt</span></samp>), etc.

   <p>Translate the title, the blue heading (if it differs slightly from the
title) and the body of the article upto the link &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">back to top</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
For example, for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>
that would be:

<pre class="example">     The Free Software Definition - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)
     
     We maintain this free software definition...
     ...
     ...If you would like to review the complete list of changes, you can
     do so on our cvsweb interface.
</pre>
   <p>Since web-translators do not speak all languages, it is essential to
mark somehow any inner markup, because very often it is hard to figure
out what translated text should be enclosed inside <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements, to name a few.  The easiest way to do this is just
to use the corresponding HTML markup, although anything else is
suitable.  For example, here is how to indicate that the link &ldquo;History
section&rdquo; at the first paragraph of the same article should correspond
to &ldquo;secci&oacute;n historial&rdquo; in the translation:

<pre class="example">     Si quisiera revisar los cambios que hemos hecho, por favor vea la
     {secci&oacute;n historial} m&aacute;s abajo para m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n.
</pre>
   <p>It is not necessary to include the value of the <code>href</code> attribute,
as it is already known.

   <p>If you wish your name to appear in the footer as a translator of the
article, please also provide a translation of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Translation:
</span><var>your name in your native language</var></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Translated by:
</span><var>your name in your native language</var></samp>&rsquo;, as you prefer.  Please also
state if you wish your email address to be published (some readers
prefer to send suggestions directly to the translator, but we certainly
do not require that translators must publish their address).

   <p>Finally, send the translation to <a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>,
either inline or as an attachment to your message.  Once online, please
check for any errors or omissions that may have resulted from the
conversion process, and report them back.
