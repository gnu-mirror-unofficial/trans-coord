<h3 class="section">2.1 Joining A Team</h3>

<p>To join a team, please first look at the existing teams at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.translations.html#TranslationsUnderway">http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.translations.html#TranslationsUnderway</a>. 
Chances are that there is already an established team.  If there is no
team listed for your language, this means that:

     <ul>
<li>There is no team established and there are no translations to this
language.

     <li>Some translations were submitted by occasional contributors, but no team
has ever been formed.

     <li>The page is not updated to reflect the current situation (this shouldn't
happen, but it's a possibility anyway). 
</ul>

   <p>If the team is marked as <dfn>orphaned</dfn>, there is no problem: you can
still submit your translation to <a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>
(see <a href="Submitting.html#Submitting">Submitting</a>).  In case you want to establish a new translation
team or become a co-ordinator of an existing one, please refer to the
next chapter, see <a href="Leaders.html#Leaders">Leaders</a>.

   <p>Contacting the team is best done via Savannah&mdash;each translation team
has its own project, named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">www-</span><var>lang</var></samp>&rsquo;, with the project
page being
&lt;<code>https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/www-</code><var>lang</var>&gt;. 
Usually teams have mailing lists, typically in the form
<a href="mailto:www-<var>lang</var>-...@gnu.org">www-<var>lang</var>-<small class="dots">...</small>@gnu.org</a>.  Some teams have homepages,
&lt;<code>http://gnu.org/server/standards/translations/</code><var>lang</var>&gt;
with additional contact details and procedures for team members.

   <p>You could also write directly to the team leader via the Savannah
interface&mdash;that way your request will be recorded by Savannah and can be
tracked or completed when the membership is approved.

   <p>The actual process of submitting translations for review varies from
team to team, as teams have certain liberties to organize themselves as
they see fit.  Thus, this manual does not make any attempt to cover that
aspect&mdash;please refer to the team-specific documentation (if any) or ask
the co-ordinator.

   <p>Certainly, it is not mandatory to be an active team member to contribute
a translation or two.  If you feel that you don't have the time to
participate actively, that is fine; you can still send your translation
to the team.  No contributions should be rejected.

   <p>If you do not hear from the team within a reasonable time frame (say,
two weeks), please write to <a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>.

see <a href="Translation-Tips.html#Translation-Tips">Translation Tips</a>.
