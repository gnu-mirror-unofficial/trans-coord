<h5 class="subsubsection">3.2.1.1 How To Track Tasks and Bugs Using Savannah</h5>

<p>The team leader has to make sure that prospective translations are
reviewed, that they do not contain obvious errors and/or confusing
expressions and that they match the spirit and intention of the original
essay.  However, many teams tend to suffer from a specific problem: team
members rely on the leader to make these extensive reviews. That is
fine, as far as it goes, and the leader should always review
translations before installing them in the repository&mdash;but it is nearly
impossible (especially for a large team) to rely on a single person for
such tasks.  Team co-ordinators often do not manage to make such reviews
in time, resulting in frustration among the team members and generally
slowing the translation process.

   <p>A solution to this specific problem is to distribute the load among more
people.  For example: Member D makes a translation of <samp><span class="file">foo.html</span></samp>
and uploads <samp><span class="file">foo.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp> in the translation project's
repository at Savannah, marking the relevant task as &ldquo;Ready for Test&rdquo;
(of course, the equivalent is sending a message with the attached
translation to the team's mailing list, or similar).  Then Member A, B
and C (or only A and B if C is currently busy) review it independently
and post comments/suggestions/errors in the bug tracker.  Discussion
goes on between them and D, problems are rectified and finally the
leader (who may happen to be one of A, B, C, D) makes a final review. 
It is easier to make the final review when most of the issues are
already fixed in previous revisions.  Finally, the translation is
published.  The result is better quality of the translation (since more
people looked at it) and the whole burden does not fall solely on the
shoulders of the leader.  You can also set up an internal formal rule:
If a member makes a translation, he has to review another one (or two)
as well.

   <p>Some translations can take a fairly long time&mdash;the typical example is a
complicated essay or a transcript of a speech.  It is best to avoid
duplicate work by indicating, or better&mdash;recording, that someone is
working on this specific article.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Tasks</span></samp>&rsquo; tracker is suitable
for this purpose.

   <p>It is prudent to discuss the most convenient naming scheme and practice
among team members, and publish the convention and/or rules at the
team's homepage.  Note that you can create <dfn>Custom Fields</dfn> in the
trackers, and resolved bugs can be searched based on these custom
values.

   <p>Thus, a possible straightforward way to manage these tasks is:

     <ul>
<li>If someone starts working on a new translation, she creates a new task
with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>&rsquo; indicating the article, for example simply
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">philosophy/bsd.html</span></samp>&rsquo; and assigns it to herself.

     <li>When the translation is finished and ready for review, the translator
changes the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Status</span></samp>&rsquo; to &ldquo;Ready For Test&rdquo;.

     <li>Other members review it, and open bugs relevant to one specific problem. 
It is usually better not to conflate two different issues together&mdash;it
makes them harder to discuss, and hard to track them by severity.  Some
are grammatical errors, some are fundamental ones that change the whole
meaning, some are simply suggestions for improvement.  It helps if the
project admin creates new Category fields for every article, for
instance &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu/gnu-history.</span><var>lang</var><span class="samp">.html</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">philosophy/microsoft.</span><var>lang</var><span class="samp">.html</span></samp>&rsquo;&mdash;it would enable
functionality like &ldquo;Show me all bugs ever reported against this
translation&rdquo;, which is useful.

     <li>Once the bugs (or at least the important bugs) are fixed, the team
leader can make the final review and install the translation in the
official repository, marking the task as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Done</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Bugs that are not
resolved should remain opened, naturally. 
</ul>

   <p>Of course, teams can choose to manage these things using external
resources and eventually other bug (or issue) tracking systems. 
Whatever you decide, please make sure that bugs can be reported using
free software only, and that the software providing that service is
free.  It makes an extremely bad impression if a reader has to report a
problem about a gnu.org translation via non-free hosting platforms like
SourceForge.

   <p>If you use a certain facility (i.e. a bug tracking system) to manage
bugs in translations, it is best to take advantage of
<samp><span class="file">generic.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> and advertise it on every page. 
See <a href="../gnun/generic_002eLANG_002ehtml.html#generic_002eLANG_002ehtml">generic.LANG.html</a>, for
details.
