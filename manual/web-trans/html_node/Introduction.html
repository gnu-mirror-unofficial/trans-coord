<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This manual is an attempt to describe in detail the process of
translating www.gnu.org articles&mdash;how to join a team, or start a new
one, the responsibilities of the team members and leaders, as well as
some peculiarities of the GNU Project&rsquo;s website when it comes to
localization.
</p>
<p>The GNU website contains hundreds of documents, most of them
philosophical articles (essays) and technical documents which need to be
translated to make them available to a broader audience.  This is
especially important for the philosophy-related materials, as many
people do not speak English and even those that do usually prefer to
read such articles in their native language.  Dealing with the task of
translating a website this large is a hard job, and too often people
volunteering as translators get frustrated or lose interest in keeping
up with that work.  Reading this manual, and the related GNUN manual
(see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/html_node/index.html#Top">GNUnited Nations</a> in <cite>The GNUnited Nations Manual</cite>), is
just the tip of the iceberg.  This is not meant to discourage any
potential volunteer; rather, we prefer to be honest and to give
preliminary estimation of the work/responsibility involved&mdash;if you feel
you are not in a position to help you may move on to a smaller project
before going through all procedures.
</p>
<p>It is important to realize that being a GNU Web Translator is a hard job
at all levels, but your help is much appreciated and is invaluable
contribution to the society.  While there are many people who contribute
to our community by writing free software (and their number is
constantly increasing), the ones actively engaged in teaching others to
appreciate and defend their freedom are only a few.  Consequently and
rather unfortunately, there are not so many volunteers willing to
maintain in the long term translations of the various essays that
describe the fundamental values of the free software movement.
</p>
<p>Translators of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org">https://www.gnu.org</a> website are organized in
language teams.  Each team has one or more co-ordinators, who are
responsible for the respective team; they are also referred to as
leaders or (when multiple in a single team) co-leaders.  The
co-ordinators participate in the Savannah &lsquo;<samp>trans-coord</samp>&rsquo;
organizational project, which is managed by the GNU Web Translation
Managers (also known as Translation Managers or web-translators).
The manual is organized in chapters that follow the
organizational structure of the whole translation project.
</p>
<p>For the issues common for all translators,
see <a href="Translation-Process.html#Translation-Process">Translation Process</a>. The sections of that chapter are sorted
so that those interesting for less involved people (like occasional
contributors) come first; the technical details tend to be at the end.
</p>
<p>If you wish to join a translation team or contribute a translation or
two, see <a href="Members.html#Members">Members</a>.  If your intention is to form a translation team,
see <a href="Leaders.html#Leaders">Leaders</a>.
