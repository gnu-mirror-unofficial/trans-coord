<h3 class="section">6.1 Related Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>Here is a short summary of the mailing lists relevant to the translation
process, and a brief description about how they relate to the various
participants in the process.

     <dl>
<dt><a href="mailto:www-discuss@gnu.org">www-discuss@gnu.org</a><dd>The basic discussion list of the GNU Webmasters.  All team leaders are
required to subscribe.

     <p>This is a private mailing list.

     <br><dt><a href="mailto:www-commits@gnu.org">www-commits@gnu.org</a><dd>Commits to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">www</span></samp>&rsquo; repository are sent here.  All Translation
Managers are required to subscribe.  It is strongly recommended that
team leaders subscribe&mdash;in any case they should, and mail delivery can
be disabled personally.

     <p>This is a public mailing list, so everyone can subscribe and review the
archives.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">www</span></samp>&rsquo; CVS repository is also public.

     <br><dt><a href="mailto:trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org">trans-coord-discuss@gnu.org</a><dd>The main discussion list for the GNU Web Translators.  Team leaders must
subscribe, as errors from GNUN are mailed here.  Active team members are
highly recommended to join as well, because the changes in general
policies for translations are also announced and discussed here.

     <p>This is a private mailing list.

     <br><dt><a href="mailto:trans-coord-news@gnu.org">trans-coord-news@gnu.org</a><dd>This is a list for notifications about gnunews and GNUnited Nations
releases.  It is not mandatory to subscribe to it, although the traffic
is very low.  If you want to track only GNUN release announcements,
subscribe to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnun</span></samp>&rsquo; topic via Mailman's user interface. 
Likewise, if you want to receive only <dfn>What's New</dfn> updates,
subscribe to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">whatsnew</span></samp>&rsquo; topic.

     <p>Automatic announcements for new gnu.org translations (provided they're
handled by GNUN) are also delivered here.  There are separate
&lsquo;<samp><var>lang</var><span class="samp">-ann</span></samp>&rsquo; topics for every GNUN-aware language, so it is a
good idea to advertise this capability widely among your local
community.  For example, if a reader wants to be informed only about new
Spanish translations, she can just subscribe to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">es-ann</span></samp>&rsquo;
mailing list topic.

     <p>This is a public mailing list.

     <br><dt><a href="mailto:trans-coord-devel@gnu.org">trans-coord-devel@gnu.org</a><dd>All development of GNUN happens here.  Commits to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">trans-coord</span></samp>&rsquo;
repository are also sent to this list.

     <p>This is a public list, and <a href="mailto:bug-gnun@gnu.org">bug-gnun@gnu.org</a> is an alias.

     <br><dt><a href="mailto:trans-coord-logs@gnu.org">trans-coord-logs@gnu.org</a><dd>All build logs from the various GNUN automatic builds are sent to this
list, so it is not a very pleasant thing to be subscribed, especially if
you are not interested in GNUN's internals.  However, everyone can use
the web archives to check the log why a particular article was not built
at expected.

     <p>This is a public list.
