<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction to <acronym>GNU</acronym>nited Nations</h2>

<p><acronym>GNU</acronym>nited Nations (abbreviated <acronym>GNUN</acronym>) is a
collection of makefiles and scripts that are supposed to make the life
of <a href="http://gnu.org">http://gnu.org</a> translators easier.  Although it is
specifically developed for the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Project's website, it
could be customized, at least in theory, to fit the needs of other
internationalized sites.  <acronym>GNUN</acronym> is in early stage of
development, but if it proves useful, and if there is sufficient
interest (and time), it is possible to develop a robust configuration
interface that would be appropriate for general usage.

   <p>It is vitally important to understand that <acronym>GNUN</acronym> is
<em>not</em> a silver bullet that solves all problems.  If we have to be
honest, deploying <acronym>GNUN</acronym> in fact even does create some
(see <a href="#Disadvantages">Disadvantages</a>).

   <p><acronym>GNU</acronym>nited Nations is free software, available under the
<acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License.

   <p>This manual is organized in way that is suitable both for translators
and <acronym>GNU</acronym> Web Translation managers (plus eventually interested
<acronym>GNU</acronym> Webmasters, if any).  It may also serve as an
introductory material and reference for new <acronym>GNUN</acronym> developers
and contributors.  Hopefully, it might be useful to people who
customize and adopt the software for a third party site or for their
own needs.  Feel free to skip sections or entire chapters if they are
irrelevant for your intended usage.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Why <acronym>GNUN</acronym> is Being Developed</h3>

<p>The <acronym>GNU</acronym> Project's website, <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>, has
become considerably large over the years.  Maintaining it requires
significant effort, and sometimes a new web standard is developed
faster than the time required to migrate all articles to the next
widely adopted one.

   <p>When it comes to internationalization, the problems are so many that
it is hard to enumerate them.  It has become apparent that maintaining
translations up-to-date is a major undertaking, involving tedious
skimming through commit logs, reviewing diffs and other medieval
techniques to catch up.  Some translation teams have developed their
own sets of scripts, but so far there has been no universal solution.

   <p>This unpleasant situation, combined with rapid and incompatible
design changes, have lead some teams to neglect the important work of
keeping their translation in line with the changing original
articles.  As a consequence, the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Project is facing the
problem of maintaining them in suboptimal ways, in order to keep the
information updated.

   <p>The reasons for developing <acronym>GNU</acronym>nited Nations are very similar
to those that lead to the inception of <acronym>GNU</acronym> gettext, or
<acronym>GNOME</acronym> Documentation Utilities (<code>gnome-doc-utils</code>) some
years later.

<h3 class="section">1.2 What <acronym>GNU</acronym>nited Nations is and Should be</h3>

<p>The basic concept behind <acronym>GNUN</acronym> is that localization of HTML
articles is similar to localization of computer
programs<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  In
articles, like in programs, not every string is considered
translatable, so translatable strings must be identified first, and
then collected in a file (called &ldquo;PO template&rdquo;) for translation. 
Articles, like programs, tend to change in time, but not every change
in the sources calls for a translation update.  Sometimes the change
does not affect the translatable strings, but sometimes it does.  So,
translators must have means to identify those changes and apply the
appropriate updates to the translation.

   <p>The <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>gettext</code> package already provides the needed
infrastructure for maintaining translations using PO files. 
See <a href="gettext.html#Top">Introduction</a>, for a basic
overview.  <acronym>GNU</acronym>nited Nations fills the gaps to apply this
infrastructure to articles in <a href="http://gnu.org">http://gnu.org</a> web
site.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

   <p>The following diagram summarizes the relation between the files
handled by <acronym>GNUN</acronym>.  It is followed by somewhat detailed
explanations, which you should read while keeping an eye on the
diagram.  Having a clear understanding of these interrelations will
surely help translators and web maintainers.

<pre class="example">     .---&lt;--- * Original ARTICLE.html
     |
     |   .---&gt; ARTICLE.pot ---&gt; * ARTICLE.LANG.po ---&gt;---.
     `---+                                               |
         `---&gt;---.   .------&lt;----------------------------'
                 |   |
                 |   `---.
                 |       +---&gt; Translated ARTICLE.LANG.html
                 `-------'
</pre>
   <p>The indication &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in two places in this picture, and
means that the corresponding file is intended to be edited by humans. 
The author or web maintainer edits the original
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>, and translators edit
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.  All other files are regenerated
by <acronym>GNUN</acronym> and any manual changes on them will be lost on the
next run.

   <p>Arrows denote dependency relation between files, where a change in one
file will affect the other.  Those automatic changes will be applied by
running &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make -C server/gnun</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is the primary way to invoke
<acronym>GNUN</acronym>, since it is implemented as a set of recipes for
<acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>make</code>.

   <p>First, <acronym>GNUN</acronym> extracts all translatable strings from the
original English article <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> into
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.pot</span></samp>.  The resulted file is suitable for
manipulation with the various <acronym>GNU</acronym> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gettext</span></samp>&rsquo; utilities. 
It contains all original article strings and all translations are set
to empty.  The letter <code>t</code> in <samp><span class="file">.pot</span></samp> marks this as a Template
PO file, not yet oriented towards any particular language.

   <p>The first time though, there is no <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>
yet, so a translator must manually copy <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.pot</span></samp> to
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>, where <var>lang</var> represents the
target language.  See <a href="#New-Translation">New Translation</a>, for details.

   <p>Then comes the initial translation of messages in
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.  Translation in itself is a whole
matter, whose complexity far overwhelms the level of this manual. 
Nevertheless, a few hints are given in some other chapter of this
manual.

   <p>You may use any compatible PO editor to add translated messages into
the PO file.  See <a href="gettext.html#Editing">Editing</a>,
for more information.

   <p>When the PO file actually exists (hopefully populated with initial
translations), <acronym>GNUN</acronym> generates
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> file.  It takes its structure
from the original <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>, but all translatable
strings are replaced with their translations specified in
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.

   <p>Original articles sometimes change.  A new paragraph is being added or
a tiny change in the wording is introduced.  Also, some articles are
dynamic in nature, like ones containing news entries or a list of
other articles.  If the original article changes, <acronym>GNUN</acronym> will
automatically rebuild <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.pot</span></samp>, and will merge the
changes to <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.  Any outdated
translations will be marked as fuzzy, any new strings will be added
with empty translations, waiting to be translated.  In the same run
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> will be rebuilt so the relevant
strings in the translation will be substituted with the original
English text, until the translation teams update them in
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.

   <p>Those changes in the original article that do not affect the
translatable strings will not lead to changes in
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.  Thus, no actions from translators
will be needed.  <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> will be
automatically regenerated to reflect the changes.

<!-- FIXME: The following paragraphs should go to a separate section -->
<!-- that explains those details like exact paths in www, diagram with -->
<!-- the basic directory layout, additional files like .translinks, etc. -->
   <p>The POT for every article under <acronym>GNUN</acronym>'s control is kept in
the `www' repository under a special directory <samp><span class="file">po/</span></samp>, which is a
sub-directory of the relevant directory in the `www' tree.  So, for
&lt;<code>http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</code>&gt; that is
<samp><span class="file">philosophy/po/</span></samp>.  Except <samp><span class="file">free-sw.pot</span></samp>, this directory
holds the canonical source of every translation, like
<samp><span class="file">free-sw.bg.po</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">free-sw.ca.po</span></samp>, etc.

   <p>Several additional features are implemented, like automatic update of
the list of the available translations.  For example, if a new
translation is added and the list of translations in
<samp><span class="file">free-sw.html</span></samp> is updated, all translated
<samp><span class="file">free-sw.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> will be regenerated.  This saves a lot
of tedious, repetitive work.  There is a basic infrastructure to
&ldquo;inject&rdquo; general information about a translation team&mdash;like a note
how to contact the team, or how to report a bug/suggestion for
improvement.  Translators' credits are also handled, as well as
translators' notes, if any.

   <p><acronym>GNUN</acronym> can be extended, and new features will certainly be
added.  The <samp><span class="file">TODO</span></samp> file currently lists some of them, but new
ideas pop up quite often.  The plan is to make a solid foundation and
develop front-ends&mdash;a web front-end, possibly based on Pootle, a
statistics facility, probably a wiki compiler, and more.

<h3 class="section">1.3 Major Advantages of <acronym>GNUN</acronym></h3>

<p>Here is a simple list of situations where we hope this suite would
prove to be useful.

     <ul>
<li>Automatic rebuild of all translations when the original article
changes.  This is the most important feature, as it prevents
accumulation of seriously outdated translations.

     <li>Global update of the whole site.  Apply the previous point to the web
server templates (under <samp><span class="file">server/</span></samp> in the `www' repository).  A
single change to such a file will affect literally <em>all</em>
articles, translated or not.

     <li>Urgent notices.  Sometimes an &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; notice is added by the
webmasters, which should appear on all pages.  Typically this is about
an event where urgent action is needed, although often it is only
relevant to a single country or even a particular city.  Such a notice
will propagate to all pages, and translators may choose whether to
translate it or not.  For example, the Urdu translation team may
conclude that there are only a few Urdu speakers in Massachusetts, to
participate in an event that will happen in Boston, so translating the
&ldquo;urgent&rdquo; notice may not be very &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; for Urdu.  However, such
notice will appear in all translated pages and people who usually read
gnu.org pages in their native language will see it, so they can take
action as necessary.  When the notice is removed, often in a week or
two, it will disappear without translators' intervention, whether they
translated it or not.

     <li>Simplification of the translation process&mdash;lots of errors and typos
come from the fact that translators basically have to duplicate the
whole HTML markup of the original.  The PO files eliminate most of the
basic markup, which is where most of the validation errors come from.

     <li>Markup consistency site-wide&mdash;it would be substantially easier to
update the site to a future standard, because translations will
naturally follow the changes in the original articles.  This also
means that translation teams do not have to undergo the boring process
of converting their articles to the new <acronym>SSI</acronym>-based layout;
this will be done automatically.

     <li>Easy updates by translators.  Modified paragraphs, links, etc. will
appear as &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; strings in the PO files, newly added ones will
appear as &ldquo;untranslated&rdquo;, and deleted will appear as &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo;. 
It is substantially easier to update a PO file, where a keystroke
takes you to the part that needs updating, whatever it may be.

     <li>Reporting and statistics.  Since the basis is standard PO files, which
are the canonical source of the translations, it is easy to manipulate
them and extract useful information. 
</ul>

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.4 Known Bugs and Limitations</h3>

<p>As it happens in real life, we don't wear pink glasses and are aware
of certain limitations and annoyances of this semi-automatic system.

     <ul>
<li>Often it is hard to figure out where precisely a change was made.  A
change in one single word in a long paragraph of the HTML article will
lead to the whole of it being marked as &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; in the PO files.  So
don't unsubscribe from <a href="mailto:www-commits@gnu.org">www-commits@gnu.org</a> yet, and be
prepared to check the CVS history of the original article.

     <li>The official build is invoked twice daily, because doing it more often
will potentially generate more messages to the mailing list in the form
of commit notifications.  This has its drawback, since translators have
to wait 12 hours until their PO files are updated, and another period
for the <samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> articles to get generated, after they
commit the updated POs.  Additionally, any errors interrupt the build so
they have to be fixed before the next articles are processed. 
</ul>

<acronym>GNUN</acronym> currently consists of a few makefiles, scripts and
optional <samp><span class="file">generic.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> files, intended to contain
article-independent but team-specific information.  They are designed to
reside in the <samp><span class="file">server/gnun</span></samp> directory, but this may change.  In all
examples in this manual, &ldquo;invoking&rdquo; means executing on the command
line <code>make -C server/gnun [</code><var>target</var><code>]
[</code><var>variable</var><code>=</code><var>value</var><code> ...]</code> while the working directory is the
root in the `www' web repository.  For the purpose of brevity, we will
refer to the above command as simply <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, which is equivalent
to <code>cd server/gnun ; make</code>.  It is desirable never to invoke
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> with the <samp><span class="option">-k</span></samp> (<samp><span class="option">--keep-going</span></samp>) option,
because an eventual error in only one make recipe might create a mess in
many articles, both original and translated.  Do this with caution, and
generally only when debugging in a safe environment.

   <p>The build process is intended to be invoked by a cron job, although
manual intervention to a certain degree is possible.

<p><a name="index-invoking-1"></a><a name="index-triggering_002c-build-2"></a>
The central part of <acronym>GNU</acronym>nited Nations is a makefile; actually a
<samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile</span></samp> since it heavily relies on features and extensions
available in <acronym>GNU</acronym> Make.  Thus, invoking a build consists of
typing <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> on the command line, or within cron.  If you are
deploying the software on a non-GNU machine, probably <acronym>GNU</acronym> Make
is installed and available as <samp><span class="command">gmake</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">gnumake</span></samp>.  If
not, you should consider installing it, since the build will fail
otherwise.  See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make">http://www.gnu.org/software/make</a> for information
how to download and install <acronym>GNU</acronym> Make.

   <p>If you don't specify a target, <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> by default builds the
target <code>all</code>, which in this case is to rebuild all translations
that are not up-to-date.  However, there are special targets that do not
depend on the standard <code>all</code> target, which can be built by
<code>make </code><var>target</var>.  Some of the variables in the next section
apply to them, and some do not.

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Variables to Control the Build Process</h4>

<p><a name="index-variables-3"></a><a name="index-variable_002c-behavior-4"></a>
The build process has several modes of operation, and they all relate to
the handling of files that are to be added to the repository or
performing certain sanity checks at build time.  The variables are
specified on the command line, after <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, in the form
<code>VARIABLE=value</code>, e.g. <code>make VCS=yes</code>.  In the future,
additional features will be implemented in a similar fashion.

     
<a name="index-VCS-5"></a>
<a name="index-CVS-6"></a>
<dl><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VCS=no</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>
Do not add any files to the repository.  This is the default.  You may
as well omit to define <code>VCS</code> entirely; there is no special code
that expects assigning the value `no'.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VCS=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Automatically add any new files in the repository.  These are any POT
files, if they are generated for the first time, and the translated
articles (<samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>) in HTML format.  In addition, if
there is no <samp><span class="file">server/gnun/generic.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> file for the
specific language an article is being generated, an empty file will be
added.  Finally, any missing PO and their HTML counterparts of the
server templates will be added, computed on the basis of the
<code>template-files</code> variable.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VCS=always</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Because <acronym>GNU</acronym> Make considers the targets up-to-date after a
successful build, if it was performed with no VCS interaction, the
important newly created files will not be added (and committed when you
do <code>cvs commit</code>) in the repository.  Assigning this value enables
additional check and forcefully adds all files.  Use it sparingly, since
it is very slow and generally less reliable.

     <p><a name="index-VALIDATE-7"></a><a name="index-validation-8"></a><a name="index-sanity-checks-9"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VALIDATE=no</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Does not perform validation of the HTML articles and PO files.  This
is the default, and not defining this variable has the same effect.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VALIDATE=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Validates all original articles before generating the POTs, to ensure
that the ultimate source is valid XHMTL.  Also, validates all
generated translations in HTML format and all PO files.  It is highly
recommended to run the build this way, even if it is a bit tedious to
fix the errors that are reported as a result of enforcing validation.

     <p><a name="index-NOTIFY-10"></a><a name="index-mail_002c-notifications-11"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NOTIFY=no</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Do not send email notifications about errors.  This is the default.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NOTIFY=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If an error occurs, send a mail with a meaningful subject and the
error message as body to the concerned party.  The variables
<code>devel-addr</code>, <code>web-addr</code> and <code>transl-addr</code> control the
recipients; normally they should be set to the <acronym>GNUN</acronym>
maintainers, webmasters and translators accordingly.

     <p><a name="index-VERBOSE-12"></a><a name="index-output_002c-detailed-13"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VERBOSE=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If defined, the value of the variables <code>templates-translated</code>,
<code>home-translated</code>, <code>ALL_POTS</code>, <code>articles-translated</code> and
<code>gnunews</code> will be printed to the standard output.  This is off by
default, but recommended in general since it will show a bug in the
computation of the basic variables.

     <p><a name="index-GRACE-14"></a><a name="index-fuzzy-strings-15"></a><a name="index-grace-period-16"></a><a name="index-deferred-generation-of-articles-17"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GRACE=</span><var>days</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If defined, ordinary articles that have fuzzy strings and are not older
than <var>days</var> will not be regenerated.  This functionality is
implemented specifically to prevent gratuitous replacement of translated
strings with the English text when there are only minor formatting
changes in the original.  The translator has time (the &ldquo;grace&rdquo; period
as defined in this variable) to review the changes and unfuzzy the
strings, while keeping the online translation intact.  Note that this
variable has no effect on the homepage, the server templates, gnunews
and all articles defined in the variable <code>no-grace-articles</code>.

     <p><a name="index-TEAM-18"></a><a name="index-variable_002c-team-19"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">TEAM=</span><var>lang</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The translation team which articles need to be checked for
completeness.  This variable is applicable only for the <code>report</code>
target, and is mandatory for it.  See <a href="#report">report</a>.

   </dl>

   <p>Note that <code>VCS=yes,always</code> is a valid combination: because POT
files of the server templates are not handled by <code>always</code>,
running the build this way will commit any newly added files as
specified in <code>TEMPLATE_LINGUAS</code> and will perform additional check
at the end, <code>cvs add</code>-ing all necessary files.

   <p>When validation is enabled (i.e. with <code>VALIDATE=yes</code>), the
original English articles are validated first, before any commands
that generate the other files, and <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> exits with an error
on the first encountered article.  This is done on purpose, to prevent
the propagation of an eventual error in the markup of the original
article to all translations.

   <p>By contrast, validation of the translated <samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> is
performed after it is generated and if <code>VCS=yes</code> the article will
be committed in the repository.  The build will fail again and further
processing of the remaining articles will not be performed, but this
particular translation will be installed.  The translator has time
until the next run to fix the error&mdash;usually by modifying the
corresponding <samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp> file.

   <p>If notification is enabled (<code>NOTIFY=yes</code>), and the build system
encounters errors (mostly when validating articles), email messages
will be sent to the party that is expected to fix the error.  The
subject of the messages always include the problematic article, for
example:

<pre class="example">     Subject: [GNUN Error] gnu/gnu.fa.html is not valid XHTML

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.2 Targets Specified on the Command Line</h4>

<p>Some targets are not built by default, because they are only useful
under certain circumstances.  Think of them like semi-automated
commands or canned command sequences that are more complicated, and
more importantly, whose arguments are variables computed at the time
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> reads the makefiles&mdash;the filesets they affect are
specific and already defined, one way or another.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.1.2.1 The <code>sync</code> target</h5>

<p><a name="index-synchronization_002c-repository-20"></a>
The <code>sync</code> target has a simple task: synchronize the
<em>original English</em> articles from a canonical repository, like
`www'.  It is very important that such synchronization happens,
because it is desirable to develop the software and add more features
in a testbed, while the `official instance' operates on the official
repository in a predictable way.

   <p>It is recommended that you `build' the <code>sync</code> target from a cron
job, some time before the general build occurs.  That way,
prerequisites (e.g. original <samp><span class="file">.html</span></samp> articles) will be updated
from the canonical repository and the subsequent <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>
invocation, possibly run by cron as well, will update all
translations.

   <p>The <code>VCS</code> variable affects the behavior: if it is defined to
`yes' then the synchronized files are committed to the `testing'
repository, i.e. the <var>destination</var>.  In addition, if a file meant
to be synchronized disappeared from the <var>source</var>, a warning mail
will be sent to the address defined in the <code>devel-addr</code> variable
(defined only in <samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile</span></samp>).  The build will continue without
failure, and will sync and commit all other files, but will send the
same email message again if the file is still present in the
<code>files-to-sync</code> variable during a subsequent invocation.

   <p>In addition, <code>sync</code> synchronizes all &ldquo;verbatim&rdquo; server
templates that are not under <acronym>GNUN</acronym>'s control, such as
<samp><span class="file">server/header.html</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">server/footer.html</span></samp> and their
translations, as defined in the <code>verbatim-templates</code> variable. 
This is important, as these files may change in the master repository,
while the validation of the html files in the development repository
will be performed with the old templates expanded, thus making this
specific test more or less bogus.

   <p><code>VCS=always</code> has no effect on this target, as well as
<code>VALIDATE</code>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.1.2.2 The <code>report</code> target</h5>

<p><a name="index-reporting-21"></a><a name="index-status_002c-translations-22"></a>
This target exists solely for convenience to translators, enabling them
to check which articles are not 100% translated and have to be updated. 
The way to check this is by running <code>make report TEAM=</code><var>lang</var>,
where <var>lang</var> is the language code, as usual.  Thus, to check all
French translations, one would run

<pre class="example">     make report TEAM=fr
</pre>
   <p><strong>Caution:</strong> This target checks only the PO files; if there are
translations that are maintained in the old-fashioned way, they are
not reported since there is no reasonable way to check if they are
up-to-date.  In fact, this is one of the main reasons GNUN is being
developed, if you recall.

</div>

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.1.2.3 The <code>triggers</code> target</h5>

<p>This is a special target intended to be run by the automatic build
after the main build and <em>after</em> <code>cvs commit</code>.

   <p>When a <acronym>GNUN</acronym> build completes and some translations fail at the
XHTML validation stage, the result is checked in the repository, as
explained earlier (see <a href="#Runtime-Variables">Runtime Variables</a>).  Thus, CVS updates the
$<!-- /@w -->Date$ RCS keyword (or any other keywords, for that matter) and
resets the file(s) timestamp.  Next time <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> is invoked, the
target appears newer than the prerequisite so no rebuild is triggered. 
The purpose of the <code>triggers</code> target is to &ldquo;save&rdquo; the information
of the faulty targets during the main build, and to touch their
prerequisites in order such invalid articles not to remain online
unnoticed.

   <p>The <code>triggers</code> target currently executes the files named
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html.hook</span></samp> in the <samp><span class="file">server/gnun</span></samp>
directory&mdash;these files are created during the main build and each of
them contains the command to update the timestamp of the prerequisite
based on the timestamp of the target that must be rebuilt.  Finally, it
deletes all those <samp><span class="file">*.hook</span></samp> files.

   <p>To summarize, for effective operation <acronym>GNUN</acronym> should be invoked
automatically as <code>make ; cvs commit -m ... ; make triggers</code>. 
To illustrate this, here is a concrete example showing the official job
running at fencepost.gnu.org:

<pre class="example">     25 4,16 * * *  cd $HOME/projects/www ; cvs -q update &amp;&gt;/dev/null ; \
                      make -j4 -C server/gnun VCS=yes VALIDATE=yes NOTIFY=yes \
                      VERBOSE=yes GRACE=30 ; cvs commit -m \
                      "Automatic update by GNUnited Nations." ; \
                      make -C server/gnun triggers
</pre>
   <p>In the future, this target may be extended further to do other useful
things that should be &ldquo;triggered&rdquo; after the main build.

The file <samp><span class="file">gnun.mk</span></samp> contains variable definitions, based on which
almost all other important variables are computed.  In other words,
the variables defined in that file directly affect the overall
behavior of the build process.

   <p>There are two types of variables, which are specifically separated in
order to make translators' life easier: variables that translators are
free to modify and variables that are modified by the web-translators
staff<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, ideally after performing some local
tests.  A translation team leader should update only
<code>TEMPLATE_LINGUAS</code> and <code>HOME_LINGUAS</code>; everything else is

not, that is a bug that should be reported and fixed.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Working with PO Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-PO_002c-editing-38"></a>
We anticipate that some gnu.org translators will find this format odd
or inconvenient, if they never happened to work with PO files before. 
Don't worry, you will soon get accustomed to it.  It is the
established format for translations in the Free World, and you should
have no problems if you have translated software before.

   <p>The most efficient way to edit a PO file is using a specialized PO
editor, because each of them represents and treats gettext messages in
a consistent and predictable way.  It is possible to edit a PO file
with an ordinary plain text editor, but extra effort would be
necessary to make it valid.  Here is a list of widely used PO editors:

     
<a name="index-PO-editors-39"></a>
<ul><li>PO mode.  We recommend using <acronym>GNU</acronym> Emacs in PO mode, because
Emacs is the program that is suitable for performing any task when it
comes to maintaining the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Project's website.  Provided
that you have <acronym>GNU</acronym> gettext installed, any <samp><span class="file">.po</span></samp> file you
visit should automatically switch to PO mode.  You can enable/disable
it by <code>M-x po-mode &lt;RET&gt;</code>.  On some <acronym>GNU</acronym>/Linux
distros such as gNewSense, PO mode is available in a separate package,
<code>gettext-el</code>. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext">http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext</a>.

     <li>gTranslator&mdash;the <acronym>GNOME</acronym> PO editor.  See
<a href="http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net">http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net</a>.

     <li>Lokalize&mdash;the <acronym>KDE</acronym> 4 editor.  See
<a href="http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize">http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize</a>.

     <li>KBabel&mdash;the <acronym>KDE</acronym> 3 editor.  See <a href="http://kbabel.kde.org">http://kbabel.kde.org</a>.

     <li>Poedit&mdash;another popular editor that is based on the <code>wxWidgets</code>
graphical toolkit.  See <a href="http://www.poedit.net">http://www.poedit.net</a>.

     <li>Virtaal&mdash;a relevantly new editor that supports also the XLIFF format
and uses the Translate Toolkit API.  See
<a href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/virtaal">http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/virtaal</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 Starting a New Translation</h4>

<p><a name="index-translation_002c-new-40"></a><a name="index-new-translation-41"></a>
To start a new translation, the easiest way is to copy the existing POT
as <samp><span class="file">article.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>, where <var>lang</var> is your language code. 
For example, to prepare for a new translation of the essay
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>, you can simply do
<code>cd philosophy/po ; cp free-sw.pot free-sw.</code><var>lang</var><code>.po</code> and then
edit the latter.  If <samp><span class="file">free-sw.pot</span></samp> does not exist it is because
either the article is not yet &ldquo;templated&rdquo; (i.e. migrated to the new
style), or the <acronym>GNUN</acronym> maintainers have not yet added it to the
value of the appropriate variable in <samp><span class="file">server/gnun/gnun.mk</span></samp>.  In
that case, just ask them to do the necessary in order the POT to be
generated.

   <p>You could also use the <samp><span class="command">msginit</span></samp> utility that would populate
the PO file header with the right information, provided your
environment is set up correctly.  See <a href="gettext.html#msginit-Invocation">msginit Invocation</a>.

   <p>The PO file header as generated usually looks like this:

<pre class="example">     # SOME DESCRIPTIVE TITLE
     # Copyright (C) YEAR Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     # This file is distributed under the same license as the PACKAGE package.
     # FIRST AUTHOR &lt;EMAIL@ADDRESS&gt;, YEAR.
     #
     #, fuzzy
     msgid ""
     msgstr ""
     "Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION\n"
     "POT-Creation-Date: 2008-02-06 16:25-0500\n"
     "PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE\n"
     "Last-Translator: FULL NAME &lt;EMAIL@ADDRESS&gt;\n"
     "Language-Team: LANGUAGE &lt;LL@li.org&gt;\n"
     "MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
     "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=CHARSET\n"
     "Content-Transfer-Encoding: ENCODING\n"
</pre>
   <p>You have to edit the header to match the already established
conventions, and the rules for gnu.org translations.  For reference,
here is a list with all fields explained:

   <p><a name="index-PO-headers-42"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Project-Id-Version</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Add here the filename of the original article, without the
sub-directory, like &ldquo;banner.html&rdquo; or &ldquo;free-sw.html&rdquo;.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">POT-Creation-Date</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Do not edit this field, it is already set when the POT is created.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PO-Revision-Date</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Likewise, do not edit.  This field is automatically filled in when you
save the file with any decent PO editor.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Last-Translator</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The name and email address of the last translator who have edited the
translation.  Pay attention that normally this is the name of a member
of your team, it can be the translation team leader if he/she was the
person who updated the translation.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          Elvis Parsley &lt;king@grassland.com&gt;
</pre>
     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Language-Team</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This field should contain the mailing list on which the translation
team can be reached&mdash;sometimes this is the alias
<a href="mailto:web-translators-LANG@gnu.org">web-translators-LANG@gnu.org</a>, but in some cases it is a
separate, non-<acronym>GNU</acronym> list.  It could be a URL of the team's
homepage, provided that it contains contact details.  Example:

     <pre class="example">          French &lt;trad-gnu@april.org&gt;
</pre>
     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MIME-Version</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Leave it like it is.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Content-Type</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Usually this is <code>text/plain; charset=UTF-8</code>; change the charset
accordingly.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Content-Transfer-Encoding</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Set this to <code>8bit</code>.  Note that the PO file header ends with this
field, and it should contain a newline (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo;).  Unfortunately, some
PO editors remove the newline, which causes an unnecessary revision when
the file is automatically modified by <acronym>GNUN</acronym>'s rules. 
</dl>

   <p>Here is an example of a properly edited header:

<pre class="example">     # Bulgarian translation of http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
     # Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     # This file is distributed under the same license as the gnu.org article.
     # Yavor Doganov &lt;yavor@gnu.org&gt;, 2008.
     #
     msgid ""
     msgstr ""
     "Project-Id-Version: free-sw.html\n"
     "POT-Creation-Date: 2008-02-06 16:25-0500\n"
     "PO-Revision-Date: 2008-02-09 15:23+0200\n"
     "Last-Translator: Yavor Doganov &lt;yavor@gnu.org&gt;\n"
     "Language-Team: Bulgarian &lt;dict@fsa-bg.org&gt;\n"
     "MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
     "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
     "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8-bit\n"
</pre>
   <p>Notice the absence of the &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; marker; you should &ldquo;unfuzzy&rdquo; the
header after entering the necessary information (this is done by
simply pressing &lt;TAB&gt; in PO mode).

   <p>There are some special messages that appear in the POT and PO:

     
<a name="index-notes_002c-translators-43"></a>
<a name="index-translators_0027-notes-44"></a>
<dl><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*GNUN-SLOT: TRANSLATOR'S NOTES*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is for translator's notes that are injected in the resulting
translation.  See <a href="#Notes-Slot">Notes Slot</a>, for more information.  If your
translation does not have notes, you <em>must</em> translate this as a
space, that is, &lt;SPC&gt;.

     <p><a name="index-credits_002c-translators-45"></a><a name="index-translators_0027-credits-46"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*GNUN-SLOT: TRANSLATOR'S CREDITS*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is again optional, and should contain the name (and address) of
the person who made the translation.  &ldquo;Translate&rdquo; this string as a
space (&lt;SPC&gt;) if you do not want your name to appear there. 
See <a href="#Credits-Slot">Credits Slot</a>. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-wrapping-long-lines-47"></a><a name="index-long-lines_002c-wrap-48"></a>Most of the PO editors do not wrap long lines that inevitably appear in
<code>msgstr</code>'s.  If that happens, long lines make reading subsequent
diffs harder, and are generally annoying for most people.  If this issue
bothers you, you can &ldquo;normalize&rdquo; the already finished PO translation
by executing on the command line <code>msgcat -o </code><var>file</var><code>.po
</code><var>file</var><code>.po</code>, before installing it in the repository.  Either way, the
build system will treat it is a valid PO file.

   <p>For those lucky Emacs users, here is a code snippet that you can put
in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>; doing <kbd>M-x po-wrap</kbd> while in PO mode will
wrap all long lines:

<pre class="lisp">     (defun po-wrap ()
       "Filter current po-mode buffer through `msgcat' tool to wrap all lines."
       (interactive)
       (if (eq major-mode 'po-mode)
           (let ((tmp-file (make-temp-file "po-wrap."))
     	    (tmp-buf (generate-new-buffer "*temp*")))
     	(unwind-protect
     	    (progn
     	      (write-region (point-min) (point-max) tmp-file nil 1)
     	      (if (zerop
     		   (call-process
     		    "msgcat" nil tmp-buf t (shell-quote-argument tmp-file)))
     		  (let ((saved (point))
     			(inhibit-read-only t))
     		    (delete-region (point-min) (point-max))
     		    (insert-buffer tmp-buf)
     		    (goto-char (min saved (point-max))))
     		(with-current-buffer tmp-buf
     		  (error (buffer-string)))))
     	  (kill-buffer tmp-buf)
     	  (delete-file tmp-file)))))
</pre>
   <p>It is highly desirable that you check if the PO file you finished
translating (or editing) is valid, before committing it.  This is done
by running <code>msgfmt -cv -o /dev/null </code><var>file</var> or by simply
pressing <kbd>V</kbd> in PO mode.  The build system automatically verifies
each PO file when invoked with <code>VALIDATE=yes</code>, but you won't get a
warm and fuzzy feeling if a stupid typo you made halts the whole update
of all translations.  Such things happen to everyone, so it is a good
practice to check before you actually commit.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.1 The Special Slot for Translator's Notes</h5>

<p><a name="index-notes_002c-translators-49"></a><a name="index-translators_0027-notes-50"></a>
Sometimes it is necessary to complement the translation of an essay
with translator's notes.  The special message <code>*GNUN-SLOT:
TRANSLATOR'S NOTES*</code> is designed to serve this purpose.  If your
translation doesn't have notes, you should &ldquo;translate&rdquo; the
<code>msgstr</code> as a space (&lt;SPC&gt;)&mdash;otherwise the text of the
<code>msgid</code> will appear in the HTML translation, which is not what
you want.  Here is an example how to use translators' notes in a PO
file:

<pre class="example">     # type: Content of: &lt;p&gt;
     msgid ""
     "To understand the concept, you should think of &lt;q&gt;free&lt;/q&gt; "
     "as in &lt;q&gt;free speech,&lt;/q&gt; not as in &lt;q&gt;free beer.&lt;/q&gt;"
     msgstr ""
     "Translated message, where you want to clarify beer&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a "
     "href=\"#TransNote1\"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, presumably because the "
     "expression in your language is different"
     ...
     ...
     # type: Content of: &lt;div&gt;
     #. TRANSLATORS: Use space (SPC) as msgstr if you don't have notes.
     msgid "*GNUN-SLOT: TRANSLATOR'S NOTES*"
     msgstr ""
     "&lt;b&gt;Translator's notes&lt;/b&gt;:\n"
     "&lt;ol&gt;\n"
     "&lt;li id=\"TransNote1\"&gt;Note clarifying the text.&lt;/li&gt;\n"
     "&lt;/ol&gt;\n"
</pre>
   <p>Certainly, everything in the <code>msgstr</code>s should be in your native
language; we use English here in order the example to be understood by
everyone.  If you have more notes, each subsequent one should be with
incremented number, i.e. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">TransNote2</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">TransNote3</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc. and
you have to add them as more <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements accordingly.

   <p>Do not worry about the <code>\n</code> character&mdash;it is inserted
automatically when you press &lt;RET&gt;.  It is not compulsory that
notes start on a new line, this is the recommended way simply because
it is easier to edit them.

   <p>It is important to follow this specification, because notes will look
consistently in all languages and will be clearly distinguishable from
authors' footnotes, if any.  Furthermore, it would be easier to define
a special <acronym>CSS</acronym> class for them, and also to convert the
translations in other formats such as Texinfo&mdash;when these features
are implemented.

<p><a name="index-credits_002c-translators-51"></a><a name="index-translators_0027-credits-52"></a>
Most of the translators usually put their name under the translation,
in the &ldquo;footer&rdquo; area.  This is entirely acceptable, since some
readers prefer to send buggestions directly to the translator.  Also,
giving credit where credit is due is a natural thing.

   <p>Like the previous slot, you should &ldquo;translate&rdquo; it as a &lt;SPC&gt; if
you don't want your name to appear there.

   <p>Here is an example of the recommended way to specify credits:

<pre class="example">     &lt;b&gt;Traduction&lt;/b&gt;: Benjamin Drieu
     &lt;a href="mailto:foo@example.org"&gt;&amp;lt;foo@example.org&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
     2007, 2008.
</pre>
   <p>It is highly desirable to use this form, but you may omit the email
address or add the homepage of the translator, provided that the
translation team leader ensures that it constantly meets the linking
criteria for gnu.org.  Please follow the <acronym>FSF</acronym> HTML Style
Sheet when adding <acronym>URI</acronym>s or other information.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.2 Transforming existing translation in PO format</h4>

<p><a name="index-migration_002c-translations-53"></a><a name="index-conversion-of-existing-translations-54"></a>
Migrating an existing translation to a PO file format is basically
editing the header as described in the previous section, and
populating each of the messages by copying the already translated text
and/or markup from the existing translation in HTML format in the
relevant message.

   <p>Typically, you will visit <samp><span class="file">po/foo.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp> (in PO mode) and
<samp><span class="file">foo.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> (in HTML mode) in another buffer.  Then you
can copy a paragraph or an element from the latter and yank it in the
relevant message in the former.  Be extra careful, since this is the
time to check <em>precisely</em> that the translation corresponds to the
original.  Further changes will be reflected, but if your &ldquo;initial&rdquo;
PO file is not a 100% match, that would not necessarily mean that it
is an improvement.  Since it is very easy to do this kind of check,
because the relevant <code>msgid</code> and <code>msgstr</code> appear one above
the other in the same buffer (or the similar concept in other PO
editors), please <em>do</em> perform this initial sanity check even if
you are confident that the translation you have been yanking strings
from is a completely up-to-date translation.

   <p>There is no need to delete the existing HTML translation,
<acronym>GNUN</acronym> will automatically overwrite it.  The only thing a
translator should do is to commit the PO file in the repository.

   <p>When an essay has been translated by several people through the years,
it is important that this information is recorded and reflected in the
PO file.  In the future, special targets may be added to enable the
<acronym>FSF</acronym> to check who translated a particular article, and when.

   <p>A recommended way to do this is as follows:

<pre class="example">     # French translation of http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html
     # Copyright (C) 2006, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     # This file is distributed under the same license as the gnu.org article.
     # C&eacute;dric Corazza &lt;cedric.corazza@wanadoo.fr&gt;, 2006, 2008.
     # Jer&ocirc;me Dominguez &lt;taz@gnu.org&gt;, 2007.
</pre>
   <p>In this example, it is clear that C&eacute;dric made the initial
translation, Jer&ocirc;me made some changes in 2007, and the original
translator returned in 2008 and continued maintaining it.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.3 Special Handling For <acronym>GNU</acronym> News</h4>

<p><a name="index-gnunews-55"></a><a name="index-whatsnew-56"></a><a name="index-gnusflashes-57"></a>
The <acronym>GNU</acronym> website has infrastructure for supporting &ldquo;What's
New&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;<acronym>GNU</acronym> News&rdquo;&mdash;see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#polnews">http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#polnews</a>
for details.  Entries are added in a special plain text file,
<samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.txt</span></samp> and are used to build
<samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.include</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.include</span></samp>.  The
former is used by <samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.html</span></samp>, while the latter is
included in the homepage.

   <p><acronym>GNUN</acronym> has additional rules for building <samp><span class="file">whatsnew.pot</span></samp>,
which contains a combination of all necessary strings for
<samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.include</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.include</span></samp>.  There is nothing unusual in this
POT file, so it should be translated like any other.  When you commit
<samp><span class="file">whatsnew.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>, it will be used to generate all three
localized files.  In addition, if there is a homepage for this language,
it will be rebuilt when <samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.include</span></samp> is
generated for the first time in order the translated homepage to include
it instead of <samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.include</span></samp>.

   <p>Note that localized <acronym>RSS</acronym> feeds are not supported on purpose, as
it would be annoying for subscribers if new items appear in English and
then once again translated.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.4 Useful Hints For Editing PO Files</h4>

<p><a name="index-tips_002c-translators-58"></a><a name="index-recommendations_002c-PO-files-59"></a>
This section contains additional explanations, some in the form of
advices and recommendations; not all of them are strictly related to
PO files editing.

     <ul>
<li>When you install a new translation of an article (that is different
from a server template or the homepage), all you need to do is to add
your PO file in the appropriate <samp><span class="file">/po</span></samp> sub-directory and add a
link to it in the translations list of the original
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>.  Use only HTML entities for any non-ASCII
characters and follow the established scheme.  If language names in
your native language are not capitalized (unlike for example in
English or German), you should <em>not</em> capitalize the name of your
language.

     <p>In the next build, your <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> will be
built and the link to it will propagate to all translations, provided
that they are under <acronym>GNUN</acronym>'s control.

     <li>If you don't feel comfortable editing <samp><span class="file">gnun.mk</span></samp>, do not worry. 
Someone from the <acronym>GNUN</acronym> maintainers will notice and will amend
<code>TEMPLATE_LINGUAS</code> or <code>HOME_LINGUAS</code> for you, as
appropriate.

     <li>Dealing with obsolete strings.  Elements which are removed from the
original articles appear in the PO files as &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; strings&mdash;the
translation is not lost, but they are marked in a special way at the
end of the PO file.  You don't have to update a PO file if it contains
obsolete strings&mdash;do this only if it has &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; or
&ldquo;untranslated&rdquo;, and of course when you want to improve the existing
translated ones.  Sometimes these obsolete strings are useful, and
they can save time.  For example, if you anticipate that the deleted
text may reappear some time in the future, you can preserve the string
and hopefully it would be marked as &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; when this happens. 
Failing that, you can still copy it and yank it at the appropriate
place.

     <li>You can add comments to every message in a PO file&mdash;for example if
you want to remember that you have to do something, or to remind you
why this particular message is translated in a special way.  These
comments do not appear in the generated HTML source.

     <li>Sometimes, especially when the original message contains many links,
it is easier to copy it to <code>msgstr</code> and edit the latter by
translating the English text.  In PO mode, this is done by <kbd>C-j</kbd>. 
This is useful also for large chunks of text in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> elements,
which normally you would want to preserve verbatim.

     <li>To reduce the load on the webmasters RT queue, please replace
<a href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">webmasters@gnu.org</a> in the standard footer with
<a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>.

     <li>If you translate &ldquo;Free Software Foundation, Inc.&rdquo; in your native
language in the copyright notice, then please prepend the English name
to the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>; otherwise it looks awkward in most
languages.  Example:

     <pre class="example">          # type: Content of: &lt;div&gt;&lt;address&gt;
          msgid "51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA"
          msgstr ""
          "Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, "
          "Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA"
</pre>
     <li>There is absolutely no reason to use HTML entities in translations as a
replacement for common non-ASCII characters.  They are harder to write
and serve no purpose.

     <li>Wrapping of <code>msgstr</code> using <kbd>M-q</kbd> in Emacs (or other means) is
considered harmful.  It is best to leave <acronym>GNUN</acronym> (or more
precisely, Po4a) to do the wrapping&mdash;that way all generated HTML
translations will have predictable results.  This will help tremendously
for the conversion to other formats, like Texinfo.  Also, note that not
all elements are wrapped by default, so deliberately wrapping the text
inside the <code>msgstr</code> could lead to an invalid page or a page that is
valid, but is rendered incorrectly by the web browser.

The files <samp><span class="file">server/gnun/generic.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> are special: if
no such file exists for your language, an empty file will be created

team or where to report bugs.  For example:

<pre class="example">     &lt;p&gt;To join the Fooish translation team, see &lt;a
     href="http://gnu.org/server/standards/translations/www-foo"&gt;the
     Foo team homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
   <p>The contents of <samp><span class="file">generic.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> is injected right after
the translators' credits, if any, and before the timestamp.  It should
be valid XHTML markup.

   <p>When you modify this file, for example, adding a message to the
existing empty file or changing a URL, such modification will affect
<em>all</em> articles of the language <var>lang</var> in
<samp><span class="file">generic.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>.  The next time a build occurs, all
translations of the language code <var>lang</var> (i.e. all
<samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>, including the homepage), will be modified to
include the contents of this special file.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.6 Maintaining Translations in Your Team's Repository</h4>

<p><a name="index-project-repository-62"></a><a name="index-repository_002c-translation-project-63"></a><a name="index-team-maintenance-64"></a>
<acronym>GNUN</acronym> operates on the &ldquo;official&rdquo; Web repository of the
Savannah project `www', where normally only the coordinators of
translation teams have write access.  However, all translation teams
have their own projects, so it is possible to take advantage of Savannah
as a hosting facility to make the team work more comfortable.

   <p>The PO files provide an excellent and natural way to review each other's
translations, because the translation appears right below the original
message.  Mutual reviews and proof-reading of translations is a crucial
part of the process.  Furthermore, team work is great for the community
spirit; automating some of the operations also result in more time for
all members to concentrate on the important tasks.

   <p>The file <samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile.team</span></samp> in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnun</span></samp>&rsquo; package is a
template, aimed for all translation teams who wish to use their own
project's repository as a place to keep their draft translations, until
they ripe and are ready to be installed officially.

   <p><a name="index-team-workflow-65"></a>The following diagram illustrates a typical workflow&mdash;it is applicable
for small, medium and large teams:

<pre class="example">     +----------+                   +-------------------+
     | ``www''  |                   |   ``www-LANG''    |
     |   Web    |------&gt;----&gt;-------|Sources repository |
     |repository|  automatic merge  +-------------------+
     +----------+                         |    |     |
          |                               |    |     `-- Member A
          +------------&lt;----&lt;-------------'    |
                       Leader                  `---Member B
</pre>
   <p>All members and the team leader(s) commit in their project's
repository&mdash;when a translation is ready, the leader checks it in in the
official `www' repository.  If an original article changes,
a build could be invoked to synchronize (i.e. merge) the changes and
optionally automatically commit them so that the draft PO files are
updated.  A translator would then normally update the PO file, and
commit it again in the project's Sources repository, from where the
coordinator will pick it up and install it in `www'.

   <p>To take advantage of this semi-automation, rename this template
<samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile.team</span></samp> as <samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile</span></samp> and install it in the root
of your project's Sources repository.  Then create directories and
sub-directories exactly as they are in `www'.  Do not create the
<samp><span class="file">/po</span></samp> sub-directories; they are redundant here.  Instead, install
the PO files in the normal locations where the corresponding
<samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> resides in `www', for example:

<pre class="example">     Root
       |
       |--GNUmakefile
       |--home.<var>lang</var>.po
       |--...
       |--gnu
       |   |
       |   |
       |   +--linux-and-gnu.<var>lang</var>.po
       |   +--manifesto.<var>lang</var>.po
       |   +--...
       |
       |
       +--philosophy
       |     |
       |     |
       |     +--free-sw.<var>lang</var>.po
       |     +--not-ipr.<var>lang</var>.po
       |     +--open-source-misses-the-point.<var>lang</var>.po
       |     +--...

</div>

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.6.1 Adopting <samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile.team</span></samp> For a Specific Team</h5>

<p>To adjust the makefile for your team, you need to edit two variables.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">TEAM</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Set this to the language code, like <code>bg</code> or <code>pt-br</code>.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wwwdir</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The relative path to the working copy of the master `www' repository. 
So if you have checked out your project's Sources repository at
<samp><span class="file">~/projects/www-</span><var>lang</var></samp> and the `www' Web repository at
<samp><span class="file">~/projects/www</span></samp>, the value of <code>wwwdir</code> should be
<code>../www/</code>.  Note the slash at the end, it is important. 
</dl>

   <p>Technically speaking, two variants of one language sharing the same
project and repository (such as <code>zh-cn</code> and <code>zh-tw</code>) are not
supported&mdash;patches welcome.  As a workaround, there could be two
directories with two <samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile</span></samp>s and each directory having its
own tree.

   <p>Some variables are specified on the command line, and alter the behavior
of the build process.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VERBOSE=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Print more information from <samp><span class="command">cvs</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">svn</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">msgmerge</span></samp>; off by default.  Note that <code>VERBOSE</code> can be
defined to any string, it will have the same effect.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VCS=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Update both `www' and `www-<var>lang</var>' repositories, then commit the
merged PO files in the latter repository.  By default, there is no VCS
interaction.  The VCS of the translation project repository is
determined automatically; currently only CVS, Subversion and
<acronym>GNU</acronym> Arch repositories are supported.

     <p><strong>Caution:</strong> The makefile rule will commit all local changes, not
only those that resulted from running <samp><span class="command">msgmerge</span></samp>.  Thus, it is
better to use a separate working copy dedicated solely for this
purpose. 
</dl>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Targets in <samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile.team</span></samp></h5>

     <dl>
<dt><code>update</code><dd>Updates the repositories.  Does nothing unless <code>VCS=yes</code>.

     <br><dt><code>sync</code><dd>Merges all available PO files from the corresponding POT in `www'.

     <br><dt><code>report</code><dd>Verifies which translations are complete, and prints a list (with
statistics) of those that need to be updated. 
</dl>

   <p><code>make VCS=yes</code> is the recommended command to be run periodically. 
To check the status of the translations, run <code>make report</code>.

   <p>Feel free to replace all strings with equivalents in your native
language and of course&mdash;do not hesitate to extend this file and modify
it as much as you like.  For example, useful extra functionality would
be a target that will check which files have not yet been committed in
the official repository, or which files have to be updated there
(i.e. they were updated by the team members but not installed by the
coordinator).  Either way, if you come up with something interesting, it
would be nice to send a message to <a href="mailto:bug-gnun@gnu.org">bug-gnun@gnu.org</a>, so that
<samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile.team</span></samp> gets updated for all teams' benefit.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.6.2 Automatic Synchronization and Status Reports</h5>

<p><a name="index-team-maintenance_002c-cron-66"></a><a name="index-cron_002c-team-maintenance-67"></a>
It is convenient to invoke such synchronization automatically, for
example once every day.  If you have enabled commit notifications for
the project's repository, any new changes will be visible for
subscribers.  Here is an example crontab entry:

<pre class="example">     # m h  dom mon dow   command
     @daily              cd $HOME/projects/www-<var>lang</var> ; make VCS=yes
</pre>
   <p>It is not necessary the job to be run on the team leader's machine,
since all team members have write access to their project repository.

   <p>If desired, you could set up another job to report the status of the
translations weekly or fortnightly, for example:

<pre class="example">     # m h  dom mon dow   command
     @weekly             cd $HOME/projects/www-<var>lang</var> ; \
                            make report | mail -s "Weekly statistics" \
                            www-<var>lang</var>-list@gnu.org
</pre>
   <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Most cron implementations do not allow the character
`\' as a line continuation character&mdash;the example shown is made that
way for better readability.

<h3 class="section">2.4 Tips and Hints for Webmasters</h3>

<p><a name="index-tips_002c-webmasters-68"></a><a name="index-webmaster-tips-69"></a>
This section contains some tips and general recommendations for
webmasters in no particular order&mdash;it is not mandatory to follow them,
but doing so will make translators' lives substantially easier.

   <p>First and foremost, respect translators' work&mdash;it is ungrateful and
hard, undoubtedly much harder than translation of programs.  It is
important to have as many and as better as possible translations, and
you don't have to make titanic efforts to help.

   <p>If you plan to edit a certain page extensively, please do so within the
period between two adjacent <acronym>GNUN</acronym> builds&mdash;i.e. within a day. 
That way, the POT will be regenerated only once, and translators who are
quick to update it immediately won't be disappointed if it changes again
in the next run.

   <p>Use <em>only</em> US-ASCII characters and HTML entities for the others. 
This is required because the English text in the articles serves as a
replacement of the translation when the latter is not complete.  So if
you use, say, the character &eacute; (e-acute) directly in an English
page&mdash;which is UTF-8 as declared in <samp><span class="file">server/header.html</span></samp>, it
will appear broken on those translated pages who use a different
encoding.  This specific advice is pretty much mandatory&mdash;the build
fails if the original article contains such characters&mdash;but we are
ready to fix any errors a webmaster makes.

   <p>The script <samp><span class="command">gnun-validate-html</span></samp> is useful for webmasters who
want to verify if their (potentially intrusive) changes result in a
valid markup.  Before committing your changes, you can check if it is
valid by running

<pre class="example">     gnun-validate-html philosophy/not-ipr.html
</pre>
   <p>See <a href="#gnun_002dvalidate_002dhtml">gnun-validate-html</a>, for more information.

<!-- Emacs Lisp code goes here... -->
   <p>If you want a comment to be visible for translators, place it
<em>inside</em> the element, for example:

<pre class="example">     &lt;p&gt;
     &lt;!--TRANSLATORS: Note that foo is bar in this context.--&gt;
     The fooish bar mumbles bazzling.
     &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
   <p>This will result in:

<pre class="example">     # type: Content of: &lt;p&gt;
     #. TRANSLATORS: Note that foo is bar in this context.
     msgid "The fooish bar mumbles bazzling."
     msgstr ""
</pre>
   <p>As per the established convention, start the comment with
<code>TRANSLATORS:</code> to catch their attention, and do not add a space
after the beginning of the HTML comment (<code>&lt;!--</code>), since this will
unnecessarily indent the comment in the POT.

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Any structural diversion from
<samp><span class="file">boilerplate.html</span></samp> in a specific article is likely to result in
errors from <acronym>GNUN</acronym>.  Any unexpected updates to the server
templates (such as changing the entire look &amp; feel of the site) will
most probably break <em>all</em> translations under <acronym>GNUN</acronym>'s
control.  Of course, this does not mean that such changes should not
happen&mdash;only that they must be applied in our sandbox first, to
ensure a smooth transition.

<h3 class="section">3.1 Internally Used Scripts</h3>

<p>For the time being there are several helper scripts, used internally
as commands with certain arguments in the makefile rules.  They can be
invoked separately, as stand-alone programs, and sometimes they are
useful on their own.

<ul class="menu">

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 The <samp><span class="command">make-prototype</span></samp> Script</h4>

<p><a name="index-POT-generation-70"></a><a name="index-prototype-generation-71"></a><a name="index-generation_002c-POT_002c-_002eproto-72"></a>
This is a Guile script which makes the &ldquo;prototype&rdquo; file,
<samp><span class="file">foo.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.proto</span></samp>, from which the POT is generated. 
<acronym>GNUN</acronym> is designed in such a way, because it would be no big
improvement if links to other translations ended up in the POT&mdash;it
would mean that translators would have to manually update their PO
file when a new translation is added.

   <p>In addition, <samp><span class="command">make-prototype</span></samp> guards the timestamp (the
$<!-- /@w -->Date$ RCS keyword) in order the timestamp of the translation to
be updated <em>only</em> when there are actual changes, being automatic
or not.

   <p>Finally, <samp><span class="command">make-prototype</span></samp> &ldquo;injects&rdquo; the artificial elements
`*GNUN-SLOT: TRANSLATOR'S NOTES*' and `*GNUN-SLOT: TRANSLATOR'S
CREDITS*', thanks to which it is possible to insert the name of the
translator and translator's notes, if necessary.  See <a href="#New-Translation">New Translation</a>.

   <p>Here are the options that <samp><span class="command">make-prototype</span></samp> accepts:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--article</span></samp><dd>Process the input file as an article.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--home</span></samp><dd>Process the input article as a homepage.  Specify this when you want
to create a <samp><span class="file">.proto</span></samp> file for a homepage.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">--input=</span><var>file</var></samp><dd>Input file, which can be a common article (essay) or a homepage.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">--generic=</span><var>file</var></samp><dd>Common notes for a translation team; this is the
<samp><span class="file">generic.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> file.  See <a href="#generic_002eLANG_002ehtml">generic.LANG.html</a>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">--output=</span><var>file</var></samp><dd>The file where to write the output of the script.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.2 The <samp><span class="command">gnun-validate-html</span></samp> Script</h4>

<p><a name="index-validation_002c-XHTML-73"></a>
This is a Bash script whose purpose is to &ldquo;validate&rdquo; both the
original and translated articles to make sure that they conform to the
respective <acronym>W3C</acronym> standard.  Sometimes webmasters make
mistakes, and translators too, so this tool is useful to catch errors
of that kind.

   <p><acronym>GNUN</acronym> enforces XHTML validation at build time if invoked with
<code>VALIDATE=yes</code>.

   <p>The script expects only one <var>file</var> as an argument and will exit
with an error if it is not specified (which might be the case when an
automatic variable is not expanded properly due to a bug in the
makefile).

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.3 The <samp><span class="command">mailfail</span></samp> Script</h4>

<p><a name="index-mail_002c-notifications-74"></a>
This is a helper script that runs a command, and mails the output of
that command in case it exits with a non-zero exit status. 
<samp><span class="command">mailfail</span></samp> depends on <acronym>GNU</acronym> Mailutils, or a compatible
implementation, such as BSD's mailx.

   <p>Usage:

<pre class="example">     mailfail [--dry-run] RCPT SUBJECT CMD [ARG ...]
</pre>
   <p>The <samp><span class="command">mailfail</span></samp> script accepts the following options:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--dry-run</span></samp><dd>Does not send the email message.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">RCPT</span></samp><dd>The recipient of the message in a valid format, like
<code>someone@somehost.org</code>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">SUBJECT</span></samp><dd>The subject of the message; if it is longer than a word you should
guard it with quotes.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">CMD</span></samp><dd>The command you want to run and send a mail in case it fails.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">ARG...</span></samp><dd>The arguments of <code>CMD</code>, if any. 
</dl>

   <p>Here is a typical example, similar to the way it is used in
<acronym>GNUN</acronym>:

<pre class="example">     mailfail translators@example.org "Bad PO" msgfmt -cv -o /dev/null bg.po
</pre>
   <p>This will check the validity of <samp><span class="file">bg.po</span></samp> with the <samp><span class="command">msgfmt</span></samp>
program and in case there are errors, a message will be sent to the
specified address with `Bad PO' as subject and the error output from
<samp><span class="command">msgfmt</span></samp> as body.

   <p><samp><span class="command">mailfail</span></samp> inherits the exit status of the command being run. 
If an argument is missing, the usage information is printed to the
standard output and the exit code is 1.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.4 The <samp><span class="command">validate-html-notify</span></samp> Script</h4>

<p>This script is a wrapper around <samp><span class="command">gnun-validate-html</span></samp>
(see <a href="#gnun_002dvalidate_002dhtml">gnun-validate-html</a>); it is necessary because it is hard to
capture the output of the program from a program that itself captures
the output of another program that it runs.

   <p>Usage:

<pre class="example">     validate-html-notify [--dry-run] RCPT FILE
</pre>
     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--dry-run</span></samp><dd>Does not actually send the message, just like <samp><span class="command">mailfail</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">RCPT</span></samp><dd>The recipient of the message.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">FILE</span></samp><dd>The HTML file that has to be validated for compliance with the
<acronym>W3C</acronym> standard. 
</dl>

   <p>The subject of the message is hardcoded in the script, since this
wrapper has a specific task and cannot be used to invoke an arbitrary
command&mdash;use <samp><span class="command">mailfail</span></samp> for that.  See <a href="#mailfail">mailfail</a>.

<acronym>GNU</acronym>nited Nations, like any other software, is not bug free. 
There are some known bugs and annoyances, which are listed in the
<samp><span class="file">TODO</span></samp> file, but it is absolutely certain that there are more
which we know nothing about.

   <p>If you encounter a bug, or if you have suggestions of any kind, please

<!-- The GNU Free Documentation License. -->
<div align="center">Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</div>

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
