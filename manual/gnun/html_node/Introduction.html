<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction to GNUnited Nations</h2>

<p>GNUnited Nations (abbreviated GNUN) is a collection of makefiles and
scripts that are supposed to make the life of <a href="http://gnu.org">http://gnu.org</a>
translators easier.  Although it is specifically developed for the GNU
Project's website, it could be customized, at least in theory, to fit
the needs of other internationalized sites.  GNUN is in early stage of
development, but if it proves useful, and if there is sufficient
interest (and time), it is possible to develop a robust configuration
interface that would be appropriate for general usage.

   <p>It is vitally important to understand that GNUN is <em>not</em> a silver
bullet that solves all problems.  If we have to be honest, deploying
GNUN in fact even does create some (see <a href="Disadvantages.html#Disadvantages">Disadvantages</a>).

   <p>GNUnited Nations is free software, available under the GNU General
Public License.

   <p>This manual is organized in way that is suitable both for translators
and GNU Web Translation managers (plus eventually interested GNU
Webmasters, if any).  It may also serve as an introductory material and
reference for new GNUN developers and contributors.  Hopefully, it might
be useful to people who customize and adopt the software for a third
party site or for their own needs.  Feel free to skip sections or entire
chapters if they are irrelevant for your intended usage.
