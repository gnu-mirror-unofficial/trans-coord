<h3 class="section">1.1 Why <acronym>GNUN</acronym> is Being Developed</h3>

<p>The <acronym>GNU</acronym> Project's website, <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>, has
become considerably large over the years.  Maintaining it requires
significant effort, and sometimes a new web standard is developed
faster than the time required to migrate all articles to the next
widely adopted one.

   <p>When it comes to internationalization, the problems are so many that
it is hard to enumerate them.  It has become apparent that maintaining
translations up-to-date is a major undertaking, involving tedious
skimming through commit logs, reviewing diffs and other medieval
techniques to catch up.  Some translation teams have developed their
own sets of scripts, but so far there has been no universal solution.

   <p>This unpleasant situation, combined with rapid and incompatible
design changes, have lead some teams to neglect the important work of
keeping their translation in line with the changing original
articles.  As a consequence, the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Project is facing the
problem of maintaining them in suboptimal ways, in order to keep the
information updated.

   <p>The reasons for developing <acronym>GNU</acronym>nited Nations are very similar
to those that lead to the inception of <acronym>GNU</acronym> gettext, or
<acronym>GNOME</acronym> Documentation Utilities (<code>gnome-doc-utils</code>) some
years later.
