<h4 class="subsection">2.3.4 Useful Hints For Editing PO Files</h4>

<p><a name="index-tips_002c-translators-58"></a><a name="index-recommendations_002c-PO-files-59"></a>
This section contains additional explanations, some in the form of
advices and recommendations; not all of them are strictly related to
PO files editing.

     <ul>
<li>When you install a new translation of an article (that is different
from a server template or the homepage), all you need to do is to add
your PO file in the appropriate <samp><span class="file">/po</span></samp> sub-directory and add a
link to it in the translations list of the original
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>.  Use only HTML entities for any non-ASCII
characters and follow the established scheme.  If language names in
your native language are not capitalized (unlike for example in
English or German), you should <em>not</em> capitalize the name of your
language.

     <p>In the next build, your <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> will be
built and the link to it will propagate to all translations, provided
that they are under <acronym>GNUN</acronym>'s control.

     <li>If you don't feel comfortable editing <samp><span class="file">gnun.mk</span></samp>, do not worry. 
Someone from the <acronym>GNUN</acronym> maintainers will notice and will amend
<code>TEMPLATE_LINGUAS</code> or <code>HOME_LINGUAS</code> for you, as
appropriate.

     <li>Dealing with obsolete strings.  Elements which are removed from the
original articles appear in the PO files as &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; strings&mdash;the
translation is not lost, but they are marked in a special way at the
end of the PO file.  You don't have to update a PO file if it contains
obsolete strings&mdash;do this only if it has &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; or
&ldquo;untranslated&rdquo;, and of course when you want to improve the existing
translated ones.  Sometimes these obsolete strings are useful, and
they can save time.  For example, if you anticipate that the deleted
text may reappear some time in the future, you can preserve the string
and hopefully it would be marked as &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; when this happens. 
Failing that, you can still copy it and yank it at the appropriate
place.

     <li>You can add comments to every message in a PO file&mdash;for example if
you want to remember that you have to do something, or to remind you
why this particular message is translated in a special way.  These
comments do not appear in the generated HTML source.

     <li>Sometimes, especially when the original message contains many links,
it is easier to copy it to <code>msgstr</code> and edit the latter by
translating the English text.  In PO mode, this is done by <kbd>C-j</kbd>. 
This is useful also for large chunks of text in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> elements,
which normally you would want to preserve verbatim.

     <li>To reduce the load on the webmasters RT queue, please replace
<a href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">webmasters@gnu.org</a> in the standard footer with
<a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">web-translators@gnu.org</a>.

     <li>If you translate &ldquo;Free Software Foundation, Inc.&rdquo; in your native
language in the copyright notice, then please prepend the English name
to the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>; otherwise it looks awkward in most
languages.  Example:

     <pre class="example">          # type: Content of: &lt;div&gt;&lt;address&gt;
          msgid "51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA"
          msgstr ""
          "Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, "
          "Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA"
</pre>
     <li>There is absolutely no reason to use HTML entities in translations as a
replacement for common non-ASCII characters.  They are harder to write
and serve no purpose.

     <li>Wrapping of <code>msgstr</code> using <kbd>M-q</kbd> in Emacs (or other means) is
considered harmful.  It is best to leave <acronym>GNUN</acronym> (or more
precisely, Po4a) to do the wrapping&mdash;that way all generated HTML
translations will have predictable results.  This will help tremendously
for the conversion to other formats, like Texinfo.  Also, note that not
all elements are wrapped by default, so deliberately wrapping the text
inside the <code>msgstr</code> could lead to an invalid page or a page that is
valid, but is rendered incorrectly by the web browser. 
</ul>
