<h4 class="subsection">2.3.2 Transforming existing translation in PO format</h4>

<p><a name="index-migration_002c-translations-60"></a><a name="index-conversion-of-existing-translations-61"></a>
Migrating an existing translation to a PO file format is basically
editing the header as described in the previous section, and
populating each of the messages by copying the already translated text
and/or markup from the existing translation in HTML format in the
relevant message.

   <p>Typically, you will visit <samp><span class="file">po/foo.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp> (in PO mode) and
<samp><span class="file">foo.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> (in HTML mode) in another buffer.  Then you
can copy a paragraph or an element from the latter and yank it in the
relevant message in the former.  Be extra careful, since this is the
time to check <em>precisely</em> that the translation corresponds to the
original.  Further changes will be reflected, but if your &ldquo;initial&rdquo;
PO file is not a 100% match, that would not necessarily mean that it
is an improvement.  Since it is very easy to do this kind of check,
because the relevant <code>msgid</code> and <code>msgstr</code> appear one above
the other in the same buffer (or the similar concept in other PO
editors), please <em>do</em> perform this initial sanity check even if
you are confident that the translation you have been yanking strings
from is a completely up-to-date translation.

   <p>There is no need to delete the existing HTML translation, GNUN will
automatically overwrite it.  The only thing a translator should do is to
commit the PO file in the repository.

   <p>When an essay has been translated by several people through the years,
it is important that this information is recorded and reflected in the
PO file.  In the future, special targets may be added to enable the FSF
to check who translated a particular article, and when.

   <p>A recommended way to do this is as follows:

<pre class="example">     # French translation of http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html
     # Copyright (C) 2006, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     # This file is distributed under the same license as the gnu.org article.
     # C&eacute;dric Corazza &lt;cedric.corazza@wanadoo.fr&gt;, 2006, 2008.
     # Jer&ocirc;me Dominguez &lt;taz@gnu.org&gt;, 2007.
</pre>
   <p>In this example, it is clear that C&eacute;dric made the initial
translation, Jer&ocirc;me made some changes in 2007, and the original
translator returned in 2008 and continued maintaining it.
