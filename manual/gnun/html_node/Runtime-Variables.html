<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Variables to Control the Build Process</h4>

<p><a name="index-variables-3"></a><a name="index-variable_002c-behavior-4"></a>
The build process has several modes of operation, and they all relate to
the handling of files that are to be added to the repository or
performing certain sanity checks at build time.  The variables are
specified on the command line, after <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, in the form
<code>VARIABLE=value</code>, e.g. <code>make VCS=yes</code>.  In the future,
additional features will be implemented in a similar fashion.

     
<a name="index-VCS-5"></a>
<a name="index-CVS-6"></a>
<dl><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VCS=no</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>
Do not add any files to the repository.  This is the default.  You may
as well omit to define <code>VCS</code> entirely; there is no special code
that expects assigning the value `no'.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VCS=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Automatically add any new files in the repository.  These are any POT
files, if they are generated for the first time, and the translated
articles (<samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>) in HTML format.  In addition, if
there is no <samp><span class="file">server/gnun/generic.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> file for the
specific language an article is being generated, an empty file will be
added.  Finally, any missing PO and their HTML counterparts of the
server templates will be added, computed on the basis of the
<code>template-files</code> variable.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VCS=always</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Because <acronym>GNU</acronym> Make considers the targets up-to-date after a
successful build, if it was performed with no VCS interaction, the
important newly created files will not be added (and committed when you
do <code>cvs commit</code>) in the repository.  Assigning this value enables
additional check and forcefully adds all files.  Use it sparingly, since
it is very slow and generally less reliable.

     <p><a name="index-VALIDATE-7"></a><a name="index-validation-8"></a><a name="index-sanity-checks-9"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VALIDATE=no</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Does not perform validation of the HTML articles and PO files.  This
is the default, and not defining this variable has the same effect.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VALIDATE=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Validates all original articles before generating the POTs, to ensure
that the ultimate source is valid XHMTL.  Also, validates all
generated translations in HTML format and all PO files.  It is highly
recommended to run the build this way, even if it is a bit tedious to
fix the errors that are reported as a result of enforcing validation.

     <p><a name="index-NOTIFY-10"></a><a name="index-mail_002c-notifications-11"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NOTIFY=no</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Do not send email notifications about errors.  This is the default.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NOTIFY=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If an error occurs, send a mail with a meaningful subject and the
error message as body to the concerned party.  The variables
<code>devel-addr</code>, <code>web-addr</code> and <code>transl-addr</code> control the
recipients; normally they should be set to the <acronym>GNUN</acronym>
maintainers, webmasters and translators accordingly.

     <p><a name="index-VERBOSE-12"></a><a name="index-output_002c-detailed-13"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VERBOSE=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If defined, the value of the variables <code>templates-translated</code>,
<code>home-translated</code>, <code>ALL_POTS</code> and <code>articles-translated</code>
will be printed to the standard output.  This is off by default, but
recommended in general since it will show a bug in the computation of
the basic variables.

     <p><a name="index-GRACE-14"></a><a name="index-fuzzy-strings-15"></a><a name="index-grace-period-16"></a><a name="index-deferred-generation-of-articles-17"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GRACE=</span><var>days</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If defined, ordinary articles that have fuzzy strings and are not older
than <var>days</var> will not be regenerated.  This functionality is
implemented specifically to prevent gratuitous replacement of translated
strings with the English text when there are only minor formatting
changes in the original.  The translator has time (the &ldquo;grace&rdquo; period
as defined in this variable) to review the changes and unfuzzy the
strings, while keeping the online translation intact.  Note that this
variable has no effect on the homepage, the server templates, gnunews
and all articles defined in the variable <code>no-grace-articles</code>.

     <p><a name="index-TEAM-18"></a><a name="index-variable_002c-team-19"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">TEAM=</span><var>lang</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The translation team which articles need to be checked for
completeness.  This variable is applicable only for the <code>report</code>
target, and is mandatory for it.  See <a href="report.html#report">report</a>.

   </dl>

   <p>Note that <code>VCS=yes,always</code> is a valid combination: because POT
files of the server templates are not handled by <code>always</code>,
running the build this way will commit any newly added files as
specified in <code>TEMPLATE_LINGUAS</code> and will perform additional check
at the end, <code>cvs add</code>-ing all necessary files.

   <p>When validation is enabled (i.e. with <code>VALIDATE=yes</code>), the
original English articles are validated first, before any commands
that generate the other files, and <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> exits with an error
on the first encountered article.  This is done on purpose, to prevent
the propagation of an eventual error in the markup of the original
article to all translations.

   <p>By contrast, validation of the translated <samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> is
performed after it is generated and if <code>VCS=yes</code> the article will
be committed in the repository.  The build will fail again and further
processing of the remaining articles will not be performed, but this
particular translation will be installed.  The translator has time
until the next run to fix the error&mdash;usually by modifying the
corresponding <samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp> file.

   <p>If notification is enabled (<code>NOTIFY=yes</code>), and the build system
encounters errors (mostly when validating articles), email messages
will be sent to the party that is expected to fix the error.  The
subject of the messages always include the problematic article, for
example:

<pre class="example">     Subject: [GNUN Error] gnu/gnu.fa.html is not valid XHTML
</pre>
   </body></html>
