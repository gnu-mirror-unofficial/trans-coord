<h3 class="section">2.4 Tips and Hints for Webmasters</h3>

<p><a name="index-tips_002c-webmasters-64"></a><a name="index-webmaster-tips-65"></a>
This section contains some tips and general recommendations for
webmasters in no particular order&mdash;it is not mandatory to follow them,
but doing so will make translators' lives substantially easier.

   <p>First and foremost, respect translators' work&mdash;it is ungrateful and
hard, undoubtedly much harder than translation of programs.  It is
important to have as many and as better as possible translations, and
you don't have to make titanic efforts to help.

   <p>If you plan to edit a certain page extensively, please do so within the
period between two adjacent <acronym>GNUN</acronym> builds&mdash;i.e. within a day. 
That way, the POT will be regenerated only once, and translators who are
quick to update it immediately won't be disappointed if it changes again
in the next run.

   <p>Use <em>only</em> US-ASCII characters and HTML entities for the others. 
This is required because the English text in the articles serves as a
replacement of the translation when the latter is not complete.  So if
you use, say, the character &eacute; (e-acute) directly in an English
page&mdash;which is UTF-8 as declared in <samp><span class="file">server/header.html</span></samp>, it
will appear broken on those translated pages who use a different
encoding.  This specific advice is pretty much mandatory&mdash;the build
fails if the original article contains such characters&mdash;but we are
ready to fix any errors a webmaster makes.

   <p>The script <samp><span class="command">validate-html</span></samp> is useful for webmasters who want to
verify if their (potentially intrusive) changes result in a valid
markup.  It is recommended to make a symlink somewhere in your
<samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> (like <samp><span class="file">~/bin</span></samp>)&mdash;that way you will automatically use the
latest version, provided that you regularly update your working copy. 
Before committing your changes, you can check if it is valid by running

<pre class="example">     validate-html philosophy/not-ipr.html
</pre>
   <p>See <a href="validate_002dhtml.html#validate_002dhtml">validate-html</a>, for more information.

<!-- Emacs Lisp code goes here... -->
   <p>If you want a comment to be visible for translators, place it
<em>inside</em> the element, for example:

<pre class="example">     &lt;p&gt;
     &lt;!--TRANSLATORS: Note that foo is bar in this context.--&gt;
     The fooish bar mumbles bazzling.
     &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
   <p>This will result in:

<pre class="example">     # type: Content of: &lt;p&gt;
     #. TRANSLATORS: Note that foo is bar in this context.
     #: ../../foo/po/article.proto:126
     msgid "The fooish bar mumbles bazzling."
     msgstr ""
</pre>
   <p>As per the established convention, start the comment with
<code>TRANSLATORS:</code> to catch their attention, and do not add a space
after the beginning of the HTML comment (<code>&lt;!--</code>), since this will
unnecessarily indent the comment in the POT.

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Any structural diversion from
<samp><span class="file">boilerplate.html</span></samp> in a specific article is likely to result in
errors from <acronym>GNUN</acronym>.  Any unexpected updates to the server
templates (such as changing the entire look &amp; feel of the site) will
most probably break <em>all</em> translations under <acronym>GNUN</acronym>'s
control.  Of course, this does not mean that such changes should not
happen&mdash;only that they must be applied in our sandbox first, to
ensure a smooth transition.
