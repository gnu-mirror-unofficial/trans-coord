<h4 class="subsection">2.3.3 Special Handling For GNU News</h4>

<p><a name="index-gnunews-70"></a><a name="index-whatsnew-71"></a><a name="index-gnusflashes-72"></a>
<strong>Pay attention:</strong> The practice of news handling that is
described here has been obsolete for some time now, as they are being
fed automatically from Planet GNU (<a href="http://planet.gnu.org">http://planet.gnu.org</a>). 
Nevertheless, the information below is accurate to the extent that the
support for the old-fashioned way is still available.

   <p>The GNU website has infrastructure for supporting &ldquo;What's New&rdquo;, also
known as &ldquo;GNU News&rdquo;.  Entries are added in a special plain text
file, <samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.txt</span></samp> and are used to build
<samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.include</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.include</span></samp>.  The
former is used by <samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.html</span></samp>, while the latter is
included in the homepage.

   <p>GNUN has additional rules for building <samp><span class="file">whatsnew.pot</span></samp>, which
contains a combination of all necessary strings for
<samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">server/whatsnew.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.include</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.include</span></samp>.  There is nothing unusual in this
POT file, so it should be translated like any other.  When you commit
<samp><span class="file">whatsnew.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>, it will be used to generate all three
localized files.  In addition, if there is a homepage for this language,
it will be rebuilt when <samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.include</span></samp> is
generated for the first time in order the translated homepage to include
it instead of <samp><span class="file">gnusflashes.include</span></samp>.

   <p>Note that localized RSS feeds are not supported on purpose, as it would
be annoying for subscribers if new items appear in English and then once
again translated.
