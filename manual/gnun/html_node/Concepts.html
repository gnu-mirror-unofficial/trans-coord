<h3 class="section">1.2 What GNUnited Nations is and Should be</h3>

<p>The basic concept behind GNUN is that localization of HTML articles is
similar to localization of computer programs<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  In articles, like in programs, not every string is considered
translatable, so translatable strings must be identified first, and then
collected in a file (called &ldquo;PO template&rdquo;) for translation.  Articles,
like programs, tend to change in time, but not every change in the
sources calls for a translation update.  Sometimes the change does not
affect the translatable strings, but sometimes it does.  So, translators
must have means to identify those changes and apply the appropriate
updates to the translation.

   <p>The GNU <code>gettext</code> package already provides the needed
infrastructure for maintaining translations using PO files.  See <a href="../gettext/index.html#Top">Introduction</a>, for a basic overview. 
GNUnited Nations fills the gaps to apply this infrastructure to articles
in <a href="http://gnu.org">http://gnu.org</a> web site.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

   <p>The following diagram summarizes the relation between the files handled
by GNUN.  It is followed by somewhat detailed explanations, which you
should read while keeping an eye on the diagram.  Having a clear
understanding of these interrelations will surely help translators and
web maintainers.

<pre class="example">     .---&lt;--- * Original ARTICLE.html
     |
     |   .---&gt; ARTICLE.pot ---&gt; * ARTICLE.LANG.po ---&gt;---.
     `---+                                               |
         `---&gt;---.   .------&lt;----------------------------'
                 |   |
                 |   `---.
                 |       +---&gt; Translated ARTICLE.LANG.html
                 `-------'
</pre>
   <p>The indication &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in two places in this picture, and means
that the corresponding file is intended to be edited by humans.  The
author or web maintainer edits the original <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>,
and translators edit <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.  All other
files are regenerated by GNUN and any manual changes on them will be
lost on the next run.

   <p>Arrows denote dependency relation between files, where a change in one
file will affect the other.  Those automatic changes will be applied by
running &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make -C server/gnun</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is the primary way to invoke
GNUN, since it is implemented as a set of recipes for GNU <code>make</code>.

   <p>First, GNUN extracts all translatable strings from the original English
article <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> into <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.pot</span></samp>.  The
resulted file is suitable for manipulation with the various GNU
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gettext</span></samp>&rsquo; utilities.  It contains all original article strings and
all translations are set to empty.  The letter <code>t</code> in <samp><span class="file">.pot</span></samp>
marks this as a Template PO file, not yet oriented towards any
particular language.

   <p>The first time though, there is no <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>
yet, so a translator must manually copy <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.pot</span></samp> to
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>, where <var>lang</var> represents the
target language.  See <a href="New-Translation.html#New-Translation">New Translation</a>, for details.

   <p>Then comes the initial translation of messages in
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.  Translation in itself is a whole
matter, whose complexity far overwhelms the level of this manual. 
Nevertheless, a few hints are given in some other chapter of this
manual.

   <p>It is possible to make GNUN get translations for common strings from
dedicated PO files, so called compendia.  See <a href="Compendia.html#Compendia">Compendia</a>, for more
information.

   <p>You may use any compatible PO editor to add translated messages into
the PO file.  See <a href="../gettext/Editing.html#Editing">Editing</a>,
for more information.

   <p>When the PO file actually exists (hopefully populated with initial
translations), GNUN generates <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> file. 
It takes its structure from the original <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>, but
all translatable strings are replaced with their translations specified
in <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.

   <p>Original articles sometimes change.  A new paragraph is being added or a
tiny change in the wording is introduced.  Also, some articles are
dynamic in nature, like ones containing news entries or a list of other
articles.  If the original article changes, GNUN will automatically
rebuild <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.pot</span></samp>, and will merge the changes to
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.  Any outdated translations will be
marked as fuzzy, any new strings will be added with empty translations,
waiting to be translated.  In the same run
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> will be rebuilt so the relevant
strings in the translation will be substituted with the original English
text, until the translation teams update them in
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.

   <p>Those changes in the original article that do not affect the
translatable strings will not lead to changes in
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp>.  Thus, no actions from translators
will be needed.  <samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> will be
automatically regenerated to reflect the changes.

<!-- FIXME: The following paragraphs should go to a separate section -->
<!-- that explains those details like exact paths in www, diagram with -->
<!-- the basic directory layout, additional files like .translinks, etc. -->
   <p>The POT for every article under GNUN's control is kept in the `www'
repository under a special directory <samp><span class="file">po/</span></samp>, which is a
sub-directory of the relevant directory in the `www' tree.  So, for
&lt;<code>http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</code>&gt; that is
<samp><span class="file">philosophy/po/</span></samp>.  Except <samp><span class="file">free-sw.pot</span></samp>, this directory holds
the canonical source of every translation, like <samp><span class="file">free-sw.bg.po</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">free-sw.ca.po</span></samp>, etc.

   <p>Several additional features are implemented, like automatic update of
the list of the available translations.  For example, if a new
translation is added and the list of translations in
<samp><span class="file">free-sw.html</span></samp> is updated, all translated
<samp><span class="file">free-sw.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp> will be regenerated.  This saves a lot
of tedious, repetitive work.  There is a basic infrastructure to
&ldquo;inject&rdquo; general information about a translation team&mdash;like a note
how to contact the team, or how to report a bug/suggestion for
improvement.  Translators' credits are also handled, as well as
translators' notes, if any.

   <p>GNUN can be extended, and new features will certainly be added.  The
<samp><span class="file">TODO</span></samp> file currently lists some of them, but new ideas pop up
quite often.  The plan is to make a solid foundation and develop
front-ends&mdash;a web front-end, possibly based on Pootle, a statistics
facility, probably a wiki compiler, and more.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Actually, it is
much more closer to localization of software documentation, where
typically strings (also known as &ldquo;messages&rdquo; in gettext's context) are
longer than strings in programs.  Nevertheless, all points raised still
apply.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> The process of converting
HTML to PO and the other way around is performed using po4a (&ldquo;po for
anything&rdquo;), see <a href="http://po4a.alioth.debian.org">http://po4a.alioth.debian.org</a>.</p>
