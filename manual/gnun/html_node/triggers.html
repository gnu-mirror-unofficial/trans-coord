<h5 class="subsubsection">2.1.2.5 The <code>triggers</code> target</h5>

<p>This is a special target intended to be run by the automatic build after
the main build and <em>after</em> <code>cvs|svn|bzr commit</code>.

<!-- FIXME: Check how Subversion behaves with keywords and update the -->
<!-- paragraph below. -->
   <p>When a GNUN build completes and some translations fail at the XHTML
validation stage, the result is checked in the repository, as explained
earlier (see <a href="Runtime-Variables.html#Runtime-Variables">Runtime Variables</a>).  Thus, CVS updates the $<!-- /@w -->Date$
RCS keyword (or any other keywords, for that matter) and resets the
file(s) timestamp.  Next time <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> is invoked, the target
appears newer than the prerequisite so no rebuild is triggered.  The
purpose of the <code>triggers</code> target is to &ldquo;save&rdquo; the information of
the faulty targets during the main build, and to touch their
prerequisites in order such invalid articles not to remain online
unnoticed.

   <p>The <code>triggers</code> target currently executes the files named
<samp><var>article</var><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html.hook</span></samp> in the <samp><span class="file">server/gnun</span></samp>
directory&mdash;these files are created during the main build and each of
them contains the command to update the timestamp of the prerequisite
based on the timestamp of the target that must be rebuilt.  Finally, it
deletes all those <samp><span class="file">*.hook</span></samp> files.

   <p>In addition, this is the rule that takes care of actually sending the
announcements if <code>ANNOUNCE=yes</code>.  Since it is a completely valid
scenario to have a new translation which is initially invalid XHTML, the
canned command sequence for announcements is recorded in
<samp><span class="file">*.hook-ann</span></samp> files, and they are treated by <code>triggers</code> in a
different way.  A newly added <samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.po</span></samp> file may be invalid,
in which case GNUN will commit an empty <samp><span class="file">.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>
file&mdash;it is not appropriate to announce it as a new translation as it
is an empty file completely useless for the general public.  The
<code>triggers</code> rule detects this case, and postpones the announcement
to the next build attempt, when the generated HTML translation is
supposed to be human-readable.

   <p>To summarize, for effective operation GNUN should be invoked
automatically as <code>make ; cvs|svn|bzr commit -m ... ; make
triggers</code>.  To illustrate this, here is a concrete example showing the
official job running at fencepost.gnu.org:

<pre class="example">     25 4,12,20 * * *  cd $HOME/projects/www ; cvs -q update &amp;&gt;/dev/null; \
                         make -j4 -C server/gnun VCS=yes VALIDATE=yes; \
                         NOTIFY=yes VERBOSE=yes GRACE=30; ANNOUNCE=yes; \
                         cvs commit -m \
                         "Automatic update by GNUnited Nations."; \
                         make -C server/gnun triggers
</pre>
   <p>The above example is for CVS; if the underlying repository is
Subversion, they need to be amended accordingly.  If it is GNU Bzr,
remember to add a <samp><span class="command">bzr push</span></samp> after commit (in the usual
scenario), otherwise changes will be committed only locally.  Since a
distributed Version Control System can be used in multiple (sometimes
radically different) ways, this step cannot be anticipated and therefore
cannot be automated.  Adding the <samp><span class="command">push</span></samp> command in the makefile
rules would not work if a so called &ldquo;bound branch&rdquo; is used, for
instance.

   <p>In the future, this target may be extended further to do other useful
things that should be &ldquo;triggered&rdquo; after the main build.
