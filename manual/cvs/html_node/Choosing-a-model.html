<h3 class="section">10.7 Choosing between reserved or unreserved checkouts</h3>
<a name="index-Choosing_002c-reserved-or-unreserved-checkouts"></a>

<p>Reserved and unreserved checkouts each have pros and
cons.  Let it be said that a lot of this is a matter of
opinion or what works given different groups&rsquo; working
styles, but here is a brief description of some of the
issues.  There are many ways to organize a team of
developers.  <small>CVS</small> does not try to enforce a certain
organization.  It is a tool that can be used in several
ways.
</p>
<p>Reserved checkouts can be very counter-productive.  If
two persons want to edit different parts of a file,
there may be no reason to prevent either of them from
doing so.  Also, it is common for someone to take out a
lock on a file, because they are planning to edit it,
but then forget to release the lock.
</p>
<p>People, especially people who are familiar with
reserved checkouts, often wonder how often conflicts
occur if unreserved checkouts are used, and how
difficult they are to resolve.  The experience with
many groups is that they occur rarely and usually are
relatively straightforward to resolve.
</p>
<p>The rarity of serious conflicts may be surprising, until one realizes
that they occur only when two developers disagree on the proper design
for a given section of code; such a disagreement suggests that the
team has not been communicating properly in the first place.  In order
to collaborate under <em>any</em> source management regimen, developers
must agree on the general design of the system; given this agreement,
overlapping changes are usually straightforward to merge.
</p>
<p>In some cases unreserved checkouts are clearly
inappropriate.  If no merge tool exists for the kind of
file you are managing (for example word processor files
or files edited by Computer Aided Design programs), and
it is not desirable to change to a program which uses a
mergeable data format, then resolving conflicts is
going to be unpleasant enough that you generally will
be better off to simply avoid the conflicts instead, by
using reserved checkouts.
</p>
<p>The watches features described above in <a href="Watches.html#Watches">Watches</a>
can be considered to be an intermediate model between
reserved checkouts and unreserved checkouts.  When you
go to edit a file, it is possible to find out who else
is editing it.  And rather than having the system
simply forbid both people editing the file, it can tell
you what the situation is and let you figure out
whether it is a problem in that particular case or not.
Therefore, for some groups it can be considered the
best of both the reserved checkout and unreserved
checkout worlds.
